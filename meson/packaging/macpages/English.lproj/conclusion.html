    <h1>Install finished</h1>

    <p>The Meson build system is now installed. Note that Meson does not
      provide any GUI applications, it is only usable from the command
      line. You can verify if your installation of Meson is working by
      running the following command in a terminal
    </p>

    <pre>
      $ meson --version
    </pre>

    <p>If the system reports that the program could not be found
      you might need to edit your configuration files so
      that <code>/usr/local/bin</code> is in your path.
