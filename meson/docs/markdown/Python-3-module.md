# Python 3 module

This module provides support for dealing with Python 3. It has the
following methods.

This module is deprecated and replaced by the
[python](Python-module.md) module.

## find_python

This is a cross platform way of finding the Python 3 executable, which
may have a different name on different operating systems. Returns an
[external program](Reference-manual.md#external-program-object)
object.

*Added 0.38.0*

Deprecated, replaced by
[`find_installation`](Python-module.md#find_installation) function
from `python` module.

## extension_module

Creates a `shared_module` target that is named according to the naming
conventions of the target platform. All positional and keyword
arguments are the same as for

need to add `dependencies : dependency('python3')`, see
[Python3 dependency](Dependencies.md#python3).
