short-description: Built-in options to configure project properties
...

# Built-in options

Meson provides two kinds of options: [build options provided by the
build files](Build-options.md) and built-in options that are either
universal options, base options, compiler options.

## Universal options

A list of these options can be found by running `meson --help`. All
these can be set by passing `-Doption=value` to `meson` (aka `meson
setup`), or by setting them inside `default_options` of `project()` in
your `meson.build`. Some options can also be set by `--option=value`,
or `--option value`--- a list is shown by running `meson setup
--help`.

For legacy reasons `--warnlevel` is the cli argument for the
`warning_level` option.

They can also be edited after setup using `meson configure
-Doption=value`.

Installation options are all relative to the prefix, except:

* When the prefix is `/usr`: `sysconfdir` defaults to `/etc`,
* `localstatedir` defaults to `/var`, and `sharedstatedir` defaults to
* `/var/lib` When the prefix is `/usr/local`: `localstatedir` defaults
* to `/var/local`, and `sharedstatedir` defaults to `/var/local/lib`

### Directories

| Option                               | Default value | Description |
| ------                               | ------------- | ----------- |
| prefix                               | see below     | Installation prefix |
| bindir                               | bin           | Executable directory |
| datadir                              | share         | Data file directory |
| includedir                           | include       | Header file directory |
| infodir                              | share/info    | Info page directory |
| libdir                               | see below     | Library directory |
| libexecdir                           | libexec       | Library executable directory |
| localedir                            | share/locale  | Locale data directory |
| localstatedir                        | var           | Localstate data directory |
| mandir                               | share/man     | Manual page directory |
| sbindir                              | sbin          | System executable directory |
| sharedstatedir                       | com           | Architecture-independent data directory |
| sysconfdir                           | etc           | Sysconf data directory |


`prefix` defaults to `C:/` on Windows, and `/usr/local` otherwise. You
should always override this value.

`libdir` is automatically detected based on your platform, it should
be correct when doing "native" (build machine == host machine)
compilation. For cross compiles Meson will try to guess the correct
libdir, but it may not be accurate, especially on Linux where
different distributions have different defaults. Using a [cross
file](Cross-compilation.md#defining-the-environment), particularly the
paths section may be necessary.

### Core options

Options that are labeled "per machine" in the table are set per
machine. See the [specifying options per
machine](#specifying-options-per-machine) section for details.

<a name="build-type-options"></a> For setting optimization levels and
toggling debug, you can either set the `buildtype` option, or you can
set the `optimization` and `debug` options which give finer control
over the same. Whichever you decide to use, the other will be deduced
from it. For example, `-Dbuildtype=debugoptimized` is the same as
`-Ddebug=true -Doptimization=2` and vice-versa. This table documents
the two-way mapping:

| buildtype      | debug | optimization |
| ---------      | ----- | ------------ |
| plain          | false | 0            |
| debug          | true  | 0            |
| debugoptimized | true  | 2            |
| release        | false | 3            |
| minsize        | true  | s            |

All other combinations of `debug` and `optimization` set `buildtype` to `'custom'`.

## Base options

These are set in the same way as universal options, either by
`-Doption=value`, or by setting them inside `default_options` of
`project()` in your `meson.build`. However, they cannot be shown in
the output of `meson --help` because they depend on both the current
platform and the compiler that will be selected. The only way to see
them is to setup a builddir and then run `meson configure` on it with
no options.

The following options are available. Note that they may not be
available on all platforms or with all compilers:

| Option        | Default value  | Possible values                                                  | Description                                                                   |
|---------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| b_staticpic   | true           | true, false                                                      | Build static libraries as position independent                                |
| b_pie         | false          | true, false                                                      | Build position-independent executables (since 0.49.0)                         |
| b_vscrt       | from_buildtype | none, md, mdd, mt, mtd, from_buildtype, static_from_buildtype    | VS runtime library to use (since 0.48.0) (static_from_buildtype since 0.56.0) |

The value of `b_sanitize` can be one of: `none`, `address`, `thread`,
`undefined`, `memory`, `address,undefined`, but note that some
compilers might not support all of them. For example Visual Studio
only supports the address sanitizer.

* < 0 means disable, == 0 means automatic selection, > 0 sets a specific number to use

LLVM supports `thin` lto, for more discussion see [LLVM's documentation](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThinLTO.html)

<a name="b_vscrt-from_buildtype"></a>
The default value of `b_vscrt` is `from_buildtype`. The following table is
used internally to pick the CRT compiler arguments for `from_buildtype` or
`static_from_buildtype` *(since 0.56)* based on the value of the `buildtype`
option:

| buildtype      | from_buildtype | static_from_buildtype |
| --------       | -------------- | --------------------- |
| debug          | `/MDd`         | `/MTd`                |
| debugoptimized | `/MD`          | `/MT`                 |
| release        | `/MD`          | `/MT`                 |
| minsize        | `/MD`          | `/MT`                 |
| custom         | error!         | error!                |

### Notes about Apple Bitcode support

`b_bitcode` will pass `-fembed-bitcode` while compiling and will pass
`-Wl,-bitcode_bundle` while linking. These options are incompatible
with `b_asneeded`, so that option will be silently disabled.

[Shared modules](Reference-manual.md#shared_module) will not have
bitcode embedded because `-Wl,-bitcode_bundle` is incompatible with
both `-bundle` and `-Wl,-undefined,dynamic_lookup` which are necessary
for shared modules to work.

## Compiler options

Same caveats as base options above.

The following options are available. They can be set by passing
`-Doption=value` to `meson`. Note that both the options themselves and
the possible values they can take will depend on the target platform
or compiler being used:

| Option           | Default value | Possible values                          | Description |
| ------           | ------------- | ---------------                          | ----------- |

| c_link_args      |               | free-form comma-separated list           | C link arguments to use |
| c_std            | none          | none, c89, c99, c11, c17, c18, c2x, gnu89, gnu99, gnu11, gnu17, gnu18, gnu2x | C language standard to use |
| c_winlibs        | see below     | free-form comma-separated list           | Standard Windows libs to link against |
| c_thread_count   | 4             | integer value ≥ 0                        | Number of threads to use with emcc when using threads |
| cpp_args         |               | free-form comma-separated list           | C++ compile arguments to use |
| cpp_link_args    |               | free-form comma-separated list           | C++ link arguments to use |
| cpp_std          | none          | none, c++98, c++03, c++11, c++14, c++17, c++20 <br/>c++2a, c++1z, gnu++03, gnu++11, gnu++14, gnu++17, gnu++1z, <br/> gnu++2a, gnu++20, vc++14, vc++17, vc++latest | C++ language standard to use |

| cpp_rtti         | true          | true, false                              | Whether to enable RTTI (runtime type identification) |
| cpp_thread_count | 4             | integer value ≥ 0                        | Number of threads to use with emcc when using threads |
| cpp_winlibs      | see below     | free-form comma-separated list           | Standard Windows libs to link against |

The default values of `c_winlibs` and `cpp_winlibs` are in
compiler-specific argument forms, but the libraries are: kernel32,
user32, gdi32, winspool, shell32, ole32, oleaut32, uuid, comdlg32,
advapi32.

All these `<lang>_*` options are specified per machine. See below in
the [specifying options per machine](#specifying-options-per-machine)
section on how to do this in cross builds.

When using MSVC, `cpp_eh=none` will result in no exception flags being
passed, while the `cpp_eh=[value]` will result in `/EH[value]`. Since
*0.51.0* `cpp_eh=default` will result in `/EHsc` on MSVC. When using
gcc-style compilers, nothing is passed (allowing exceptions to work),
while `cpp_eh=none` passes `-fno-exceptions`.

Since *0.54.0* The `<lang>_thread_count` option can be used to control
the value passed to `-s PTHREAD_POOL_SIZE` when using emcc. No other
c/c++ compiler supports this option.

## Specifying options per machine

Since *0.51.0*, some options are specified per machine rather than
globally for all machine configurations. Prefixing the option with
`build.` just affects the build machine configuration, while
unprefixed just affects the host machine configuration, respectively.
For example:

 - `build.pkg_config_path` controls the paths pkg-config will search
   for just `native: true` dependencies (build machine).

 - `pkg_config_path` controls the paths pkg-config will search for
   just `native: false` dependencies (host machine).

This is useful for cross builds. In the native builds, build = host,
and the unprefixed option alone will suffice.

Prior to *0.51.0*, these options just effected native builds when
specified on the command line, as there was no `build.` prefix.
Similarly named fields in the `[properties]` section of the cross file
would effect cross compilers, but the code paths were fairly different
allowing differences in behavior to crop out.

## Specifying options per subproject

Since *0.54.0* `default_library` and `werror` built-in options can be
defined per subproject. This is useful for example when building
shared libraries in the main project, but static link a subproject, or
when the main project must build with no warnings but some subprojects
cannot.

Most of the time this would be used either by the parent project by
setting subproject's default_options (e.g. `subproject('foo',
default_options: 'default_library=static')`), or by the user using the
command line `-Dfoo:default_library=static`.

The value is overridden in this order:
- Value from parent project
- Value from subproject's default_options if set
- Value from subproject() default_options if set
- Value from command line if set

Since 0.56.0 `warning_level` can also be defined per subproject.
