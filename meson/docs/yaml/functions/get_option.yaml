name: get_option
returns: str | int | bool | feature | list[str | int | bool]

  Obtains the value of the [project build option](Build-options.md)
  specified in the positional argument.

  Note that the value returned for built-in options that end in `dir`
  such as `bindir` and `libdir` is always a path relative to (and
  inside) the `prefix`.

  The only exceptions are: `sysconfdir`, `localstatedir`, and
  `sharedstatedir` which will return the value passed during
  configuration as-is, which may be absolute, or relative to `prefix`.
  [`install_dir` arguments](Installing.md) handles that as expected, but
  if you need the absolute path to one of these e.g. to use in a define
  etc., you should use `get_option('prefix') /
  get_option('localstatedir')`

  For options of type `feature` a
  [[@feature]] option object
  is returned instead of a string.
  See [`feature` options](Build-options.md#features)
  documentation for more details.
