# What this script does is NOT reliable. Simply adding a file in this directory
# will NOT make it automatically appear in the build. You have to manually
# re-invoke Meson (not just Ninja) for that to happen. The simplest way
# is to touch meson-private/coredata.dat.

# This is not the recommended way to do things, but if the tradeoffs are
# acceptable to you, then we're certainly not going to stop you. Just don't
# file bugs when it fails. :)
