Aspeed family boards (``*-bmc``, ``ast2500-evb``, ``ast2600-evb``)
==================================================================

The QEMU Aspeed machines model BMCs of various OpenPOWER systems and
Aspeed evaluation boards. They are based on different releases of the
Aspeed SoC : the AST2400 integrating an ARM926EJ-S CPU (400MHz), the
AST2500 with an ARM1176JZS CPU (800MHz) and more recently the AST2600
with dual cores ARM Cortex-A7 CPUs (1.2GHz).

The SoC comes with RAM, Gigabit ethernet, USB, SD/MMC, USB, SPI, I2C,
etc.

Boot options
------------

The Aspeed machines can be started using the ``-kernel`` and ``-dtb`` options
to load a Linux kernel or from a firmware. Images can be downloaded from the
OpenBMC jenkins :

   https://jenkins.openbmc.org/job/ci-openbmc/lastSuccessfulBuild/

or directly from the OpenBMC GitHub release repository :

   https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/releases

To boot a kernel directly from a Linux build tree:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ qemu-system-arm -M ast2600-evb -nographic \
        -kernel arch/arm/boot/zImage \
        -dtb arch/arm/boot/dts/aspeed-ast2600-evb.dtb \
        -initrd rootfs.cpio

The image should be attached as an MTD drive. Run :

.. code-block:: bash

  $ qemu-system-arm -M romulus-bmc -nic user \
	-drive file=obmc-phosphor-image-romulus.static.mtd,format=raw,if=mtd -nographic

Options specific to Aspeed machines are :

 * ``execute-in-place`` which emulates the boot from the CE0 flash
   device by using the FMC controller to load the instructions, and
   not simply from RAM. This takes a little longer.

 * ``fmc-model`` to change the FMC Flash model. FW needs support for
   the chip model to boot.

 * ``spi-model`` to change the SPI Flash model.

For instance, to start the ``ast2500-evb`` machine with a different
FMC chip and a bigger (64M) SPI chip, use :

.. code-block:: bash

  -M ast2500-evb,fmc-model=mx25l25635e,spi-model=mx66u51235f
