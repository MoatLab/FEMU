/* QEMU Synchronous Serial Interface support.  */

/* In principle SSI is a point-point interface.  As such the qemu
   implementation has a single slave device on a "bus".
   However it is fairly common for boards to have multiple slaves
   connected to a single master, and select devices with an external
   chip select.  This is implemented in qemu by having an explicit mux device.
   It is assumed that master and slave are both using the same transfer width.
