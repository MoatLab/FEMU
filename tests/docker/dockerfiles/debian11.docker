# Docker multiarch cross-compiler target
#
# This docker target uses the current development version of Debian as
# a base for cross compilers for building test binaries. We won't
# attempt to build QEMU on it yet given it is still in development.
#
# On its own you can't build much but the docker-foo-cross targets
# build on top of the base debian image.
