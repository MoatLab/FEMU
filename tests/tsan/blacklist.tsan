# This is an example blacklist.
# To enable use of the blacklist add this to configure:
# "--extra-cflags=-fsanitize-blacklist=<src path>/tests/tsan/blacklist.tsan"
# The eventual goal would be to fix these warnings.

# TSan is not happy about setting/getting of dirty bits,
# for example, cpu_physical_memory_set_dirty_range,
# and cpu_physical_memory_get_dirty.
