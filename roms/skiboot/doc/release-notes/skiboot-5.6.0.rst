skiboot-5.6.0
=============

skiboot-5.6.0 was released on Wednesday 24th May 2017. It is the new stable
release of skiboot, taking over from the 5.5 release, first released on
April 7th 2017. It is the first release done in a regular six week release
cycle, mirroring that of op-build.

skiboot-5.6.0 contains all bug fixes as of :ref:`skiboot-5.4.4`
and :ref:`skiboot-5.1.19` (the currently maintained stable releases). We
do not currently expect to do any 5.5.x stable releases.

For how the skiboot stable releases work, see :ref:`stable-rules` for details.

This release is a good level set of POWER9 support for bringup activities.
If you are doing bringup, it is strongly suggested you continue to follow
skiboot master.
