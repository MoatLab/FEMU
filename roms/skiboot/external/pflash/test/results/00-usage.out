Open-Power Flash tool VERSION
Usage: ./pflash [options] commands...

 Options:
	-a address, --address=address
		Specify the start address for erasing, reading
		or flashing

	-s size, --size=size
		Specify the size in bytes for erasing, reading
		or flashing

	-P part_name, --partition=part_name
		Specify the partition whose content is to be erased
		programmed or read. This is an alternative to -a and -s
		if both -P and -s are specified, the smallest of the
		two will be used

	-f, --force
		Don't ask for confirmation before erasing or flashing

	-d, --dummy
		Don't write to flash

	--direct
		Bypass all safety provided to you by the kernel driver
		and use the flash driver built into pflash.
		If you have mtd devices and you use this command, the
		system may become unstable.
		If you are reading this sentence then this flag is not
		what you want! Using this feature without knowing
		what it does can and likely will result in a bricked
		machine

	-b, --bmc
		Target BMC flash instead of host flash.
		Note: This carries a high chance of bricking your BMC if you
		don't know what you're doing. Consider --mtd to be safe(r)

	-F filename, --flash-file filename
		Target filename instead of actual flash.

	-S, --side
		Side of the flash on which to operate, 0 (default) or 1

	--skip=N
		Skip N number of bytes from the start when reading

	-T, --toc
		libffs TOC on which to operate, defaults to 0.
		leading 0x is required for interpretation of a hex value

	-g
		Enable verbose libflash debugging

 Commands:
	-4, --enable-4B
		Switch the flash and controller to 4-bytes address
		mode (no confirmation needed).

	-3, --disable-4B
		Switch the flash and controller to 3-bytes address
		mode (no confirmation needed).

	-r file, --read=file
		Read flash content from address into file, use -s
		to specify the size to read (or it will use the source
		file size if used in conjunction with -p and -s is not
		specified). When using -r together with -e or -p, the
		read will be performed first

	-E, --erase-all
		Erase entire flash chip
		(Not supported on all chips/controllers)

	-e, --erase
		Erase the specified region. If size or address are not
		specified, but '--program' is used, then the file
		size will be used (rounded to an erase block) and the
		address defaults to 0.

	-p file, --program=file
		Will program the file to flash. If the address is not
		specified, it will use 0. If the size is not specified
		it will use the file size. Otherwise it will limit to
		the specified size (whatever is smaller). If used in
		conjunction with any erase command, the erase will
		take place first.

	-t, --tune
		Just tune the flash controller & access size
		Must be used in conjuction with --direct
		(Implicit for all other operations)

	-c --clear
		Used to ECC clear a partition of the flash
		Must be used in conjunction with -P. Will erase the
		partition and then set all the ECC bits as they should be

	-9 --ecc
		Encode/Decode ECC where specified in the FFS header.
		This 9 byte ECC method is used for some OpenPOWER
		partitions.
	-i, --info
		Display some information about the flash.

	--detail
		Displays detailed info about a particular partition.
		Accepts a numeric partition or can be used in conjuction
		with the -P flag.

	-h, --help
		This message.
