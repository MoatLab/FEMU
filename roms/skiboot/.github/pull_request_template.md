Hi there,

The skiboot project (generally) doesn't take contributions via github pull
requests. Contributions should sent to the skiboot mailing list using the
git-format-patch and git-send-email tools. If you're unfamiliar with these
tools, there's a guide here:

https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/HowToUseGitSendEmail/

The list address is:

	skiboot@lists.ozlabs.org

Posting to the list does not require subscribing to the list. Posts from a
non-subscribers are moderated to cut down on spam, but anyone posting
genuine contributions will be whitelisted.

See https://open-power.github.io/skiboot/ for more details.
