ToDo-/Buglist 2003/06/04 (0.4pre6)
----------------------------------

Memory Stuff
 * devbios does not find any flash chip on some systems even though
   they are supported. One of the reasons this might happen is that
   the flash memory area is hidden using the CPUs mtrrs. If you have
   a Pentium II/III/IV or AMD K6/K7 board, you might try 
   echo "base=0xffe00000 size=0x200000 type=uncachable" >| /proc/mtrr 
   before loading the module.

Misc Stuff
 * port this driver to fit into the linux kernel's
   mtd device drivers. 
 * join with ctflasher code
 * port to *BSD (if anybody wants that)
 * disable NMI watchdog while flashing, if active
 
PCI Stuff
 * unshadow functions do not work on certain 440BX/GX chipsets?
   when loading the module, no system flashchip is detected.
 * change unshadow functions not to touch low bios area to 
   be apm and pci bios safe.

Module stuff
 * /proc/sys/kernel/bios-writable

Flashchip Stuff
 * Finnish FWH support.
 * Implement writing for Macronix and AMD.
   (Catalyst have Intel and AMD compatible chips)
 * Implement write protection checking some flash chips have.
 * Test/complete existing support
