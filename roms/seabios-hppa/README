This project implements a PDC (processor dependend code, aka BIOS)
for HP-PARISC machines.
It's based on the SeaBIOS project at http://seabios.org/

For the impatient, SeaBIOS is built for QEMU and tested on QEMU with:

  make parisc
  qemu -bios out/hppa-firmware.img

SeaBIOS can be configured with kconfig.  To change the default
configuration one can run "make menuconfig" prior to running "make".
