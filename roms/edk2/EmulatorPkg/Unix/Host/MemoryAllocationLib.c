  Allocates a buffer of type EfiBootServicesData.

  Allocates the number bytes specified by AllocationSize of type EfiBootServicesData and returns a

  returned.  If there is not enough memory remaining to satisfy the request, then NULL is returned.

  @param  AllocationSize        The number of bytes to allocate.

  @return A pointer to the allocated buffer or NULL if allocation fails.

  Allocates and zeros a buffer of type EfiBootServicesData.

  Allocates the number bytes specified by AllocationSize of type EfiBootServicesData, clears the

  valid buffer of 0 size is returned.  If there is not enough memory remaining to satisfy the

  Reallocates a buffer of type EfiBootServicesData.

  Allocates and zeros the number bytes specified by NewSize from memory of type

  NewSize bytes are copied from OldBuffer to the newly allocated buffer, and
  OldBuffer is freed.  A pointer to the newly allocated buffer is returned.

  enough memory remaining to satisfy the request, then NULL is returned.

  is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS - OldBuffer + 1), then ASSERT().
