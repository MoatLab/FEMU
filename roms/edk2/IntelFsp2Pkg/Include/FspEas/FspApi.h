/*
  FSP may optionally include the capability of generating events messages to aid in the debugging of firmware issues.
  These events fall under three catagories: Error, Progress, and Debug. The event reporting mechanism follows the
  status code services described in section 6 and 7 of the PI Specification v1.7 Volume 3.

  @param[in] Type                   Indicates the type of event being reported.
                                    See MdePkg/Include/Pi/PiStatusCode.h for the definition of EFI_STATUS_CODE_TYPE.
  @param[in] Value                  Describes the current status of a hardware or software entity.
                                    This includes information about the class and subclass that is used to classify the entity as well as an operation.
                                    For progress events, the operation is the current activity. For error events, it is the exception.
                                    For debug events, it is not defined at this time.
                                    See MdePkg/Include/Pi/PiStatusCode.h for the definition of EFI_STATUS_CODE_VALUE.
  @param[in] Instance               The enumeration of a hardware or software entity within the system.
                                    A system may contain multiple entities that match a class/subclass pairing. The instance differentiates between them.
                                    An instance of 0 indicates that instance information is unavailable, not meaningful, or not relevant.
                                    Valid instance numbers start with 1.
  @param[in] *CallerId              This parameter can be used to identify the sub-module within the FSP generating the event.
                                    This parameter may be NULL.
  @param[in] *Data                  This optional parameter may be used to pass additional data. The contents can have event-specific data.
                                    For example, the FSP provides a EFI_STATUS_CODE_STRING_DATA instance to this parameter when sending debug messages.
                                    This parameter is NULL when no additional data is provided.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS               The event was handled successfully.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER     Input parameters are invalid.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR          The event handler failed.

/**
  This FSP API is called soon after coming out of reset and before memory and stack is
  available. This FSP API will load the microcode update, enable code caching for the
  region specified by the boot loader and also setup a temporary stack to be used until
  main memory is initialized.

  A hardcoded stack can be set up with the following values, and the "esp" register
  initialized to point to this hardcoded stack.
  1. The return address where the FSP will return control after setting up a temporary
     stack.
  2. A pointer to the input parameter structure

  However, since the stack is in ROM and not writeable, this FSP API cannot be called
  using the "call" instruction, but needs to be jumped to.

  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER Input parameters are invalid.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The FSP calling conditions were not met.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      Temp RAM initialization failed.

  If this function is successful, the FSP initializes the ECX and EDX registers to point to
  a temporary but writeable memory range available to the boot loader and returns with
  FSP_SUCCESS in register EAX. Register ECX points to the start of this temporary
  memory range and EDX points to the end of the range. Boot loader is free to use the
  whole range described. Typically the boot loader can reload the ESP register to point
  to the end of this returned range so that it can be used as a standard stack.
