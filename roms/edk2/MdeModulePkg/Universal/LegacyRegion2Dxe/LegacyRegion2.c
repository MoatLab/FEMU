  Dummy implementation of Legacy Region 2 Protocol.

  This generic implementation of the Legacy Region 2 Protocol does not actually
  perform any lock/unlock operations.  This module may be used on platforms
  that do not provide HW locking of the legacy memory regions.  It can also
  be used as a template driver for implementing the Legacy Region 2 Protocol on
  a platform that does support HW locking of the legacy memory regions.
