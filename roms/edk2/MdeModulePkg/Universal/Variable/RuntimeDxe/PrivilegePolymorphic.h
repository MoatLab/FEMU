/** @file
  Polymorphic functions that are called from both the privileged driver (i.e.,
  the DXE_SMM variable module) and the non-privileged drivers (i.e., one or
  both of the DXE_RUNTIME variable modules).

  Each of these functions has two implementations, appropriate for privileged
  vs. non-privileged driver code.
