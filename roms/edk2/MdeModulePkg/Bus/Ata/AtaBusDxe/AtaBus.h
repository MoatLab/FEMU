/**
  Tests to see if this driver supports a given controller. If a child device is provided,
  it further tests to see if this driver supports creating a handle for the specified child device.

  This function checks to see if the driver specified by This supports the device specified by
  ControllerHandle. Drivers will typically use the device path attached to
  ControllerHandle and/or the services from the bus I/O abstraction attached to
  ControllerHandle to determine if the driver supports ControllerHandle. This function
  may be called many times during platform initialization. In order to reduce boot times, the tests
  performed by this function must be very small, and take as little time as possible to execute. This
  function must not change the state of any hardware devices, and this function must be aware that the
  device specified by ControllerHandle may already be managed by the same driver or a
  different driver. This function must match its calls to AllocatePages() with FreePages(),
  AllocatePool() with FreePool(), and OpenProtocol() with CloseProtocol().
  Since ControllerHandle may have been previously started by the same driver, if a protocol is
  already in the opened state, then it must not be closed with CloseProtocol(). This is required
  to guarantee the state of ControllerHandle is not modified by this function.

  @param[in]  This                 A pointer to the EFI_DRIVER_BINDING_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in]  ControllerHandle     The handle of the controller to test. This handle
                                   must support a protocol interface that supplies
                                   an I/O abstraction to the driver.
  @param[in]  RemainingDevicePath  A pointer to the remaining portion of a device path.  This
                                   parameter is ignored by device drivers, and is optional for bus
                                   drivers. For bus drivers, if this parameter is not NULL, then
                                   the bus driver must determine if the bus controller specified
                                   by ControllerHandle and the child controller specified
                                   by RemainingDevicePath are both supported by this
                                   bus driver.

                                   driver or an application that requires exclusive access.
                                   Currently not implemented.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED          The device specified by ControllerHandle and

  Send a security protocol command to a device that receives data and/or the result

  The security protocol command sent is defined by SecurityProtocolId and contains
  the security protocol specific data SecurityProtocolSpecificData. The function
  returns the data from the security protocol command in PayloadBuffer.

  For devices supporting the SCSI command set, the security protocol command is sent
  using the SECURITY PROTOCOL IN command defined in SPC-4.

  For devices supporting the ATA command set, the security protocol command is sent
  using one of the TRUSTED RECEIVE commands defined in ATA8-ACS if PayloadBufferSize
  is non-zero.

  If the PayloadBufferSize is zero, the security protocol command is sent using the
  Trusted Non-Data command defined in ATA8-ACS.

  If PayloadBufferSize is too small to store the available data from the security
  protocol command, the function shall copy PayloadBufferSize bytes into the
  PayloadBuffer and return EFI_WARN_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL.

  If PayloadBuffer or PayloadTransferSize is NULL and PayloadBufferSize is non-zero,
  the function shall return EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER.

  If the given MediaId does not support security protocol commands, the function shall
  return EFI_UNSUPPORTED. If there is no media in the device, the function returns
  EFI_NO_MEDIA. If the MediaId is not the ID for the current media in the device,
  the function returns EFI_MEDIA_CHANGED.

  If the security protocol fails to complete within the Timeout period, the function
  shall return EFI_TIMEOUT.

  If the security protocol command completes without an error, the function shall
  return EFI_SUCCESS. If the security protocol command completes with an error, the
  function shall return EFI_DEVICE_ERROR.

                                       means that this function will wait indefinitely for the
                                       security protocol command to execute. If Timeout is greater
                                       than zero, then this function will return EFI_TIMEOUT

                                       protocol command. The caller is responsible for having
                                       either implicit or explicit ownership of the buffer.
  @param  PayloadTransferSize          A pointer to a buffer to store the size in bytes of the

/**
  Send a security protocol command to a device.

  The SendData function sends a security protocol command containing the payload
  PayloadBuffer to the given MediaId. The security protocol command sent is
  defined by SecurityProtocolId and contains the security protocol specific data
  SecurityProtocolSpecificData. If the underlying protocol command requires a
  specific padding for the command payload, the SendData function shall add padding
  bytes to the command payload to satisfy the padding requirements.

  For devices supporting the SCSI command set, the security protocol command is sent
  using the SECURITY PROTOCOL OUT command defined in SPC-4.

  For devices supporting the ATA command set, the security protocol command is sent
  using one of the TRUSTED SEND commands defined in ATA8-ACS if PayloadBufferSize
  is non-zero. If the PayloadBufferSize is zero, the security protocol command is
  sent using the Trusted Non-Data command defined in ATA8-ACS.

  If PayloadBuffer is NULL and PayloadBufferSize is non-zero, the function shall
  return EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER.

  If the given MediaId does not support security protocol commands, the function
  shall return EFI_UNSUPPORTED. If there is no media in the device, the function
  returns EFI_NO_MEDIA. If the MediaId is not the ID for the current media in the
  device, the function returns EFI_MEDIA_CHANGED.

  If the security protocol fails to complete within the Timeout period, the function
  shall return EFI_TIMEOUT.

  If the security protocol command completes without an error, the function shall return
  EFI_SUCCESS. If the security protocol command completes with an error, the function
  shall return EFI_DEVICE_ERROR.

  Send TPer Reset command to reset eDrive to lock all protected bands.
  Typically, there are 2 mechanism for resetting eDrive. They are:
  1. TPer Reset through IEEE 1667 protocol.
  2. TPer Reset through native TCG protocol.
  This routine will detect what protocol the attached eDrive conform to, TCG or
  IEEE 1667 protocol. Then send out TPer Reset command separately.
