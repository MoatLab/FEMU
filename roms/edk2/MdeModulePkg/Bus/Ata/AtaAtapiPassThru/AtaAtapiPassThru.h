/**
  Tests to see if this driver supports a given controller. If a child device is provided,
  it further tests to see if this driver supports creating a handle for the specified child device.

  This function checks to see if the driver specified by This supports the device specified by
  ControllerHandle. Drivers will typically use the device path attached to
  ControllerHandle and/or the services from the bus I/O abstraction attached to
  ControllerHandle to determine if the driver supports ControllerHandle. This function
  may be called many times during platform initialization. In order to reduce boot times, the tests
  performed by this function must be very small, and take as little time as possible to execute. This
  function must not change the state of any hardware devices, and this function must be aware that the
  device specified by ControllerHandle may already be managed by the same driver or a
  different driver. This function must match its calls to AllocatePages() with FreePages(),
  AllocatePool() with FreePool(), and OpenProtocol() with CloseProtocol().
  Because ControllerHandle may have been previously started by the same driver, if a protocol is
  already in the opened state, then it must not be closed with CloseProtocol(). This is required
  to guarantee the state of ControllerHandle is not modified by this function.

                                   drivers. For bus drivers, if this parameter is not NULL, then
                                   the bus driver must determine if the bus controller specified
                                   by ControllerHandle and the child controller specified

  @param  Packet  A pointer to the SCSI Request Packet to send to the SCSI device
                  specified by Target and Lun.
  @param  Event   If nonblocking I/O is not supported then Event is ignored, and blocking
                  I/O is performed. If Event is NULL, then blocking I/O is performed. If
                  Event is not NULL and non blocking I/O is supported, then

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The SCSI Request Packet was sent by the host. For bi-directional
                                commands, InTransferLength bytes were transferred from
                                InDataBuffer. For write and bi-directional commands,
                                OutTransferLength bytes were transferred by
                                OutDataBuffer.
  @retval EFI_BAD_BUFFER_SIZE   The SCSI Request Packet was not executed. The number of bytes that
                                could be transferred is returned in InTransferLength. For write
                                and bi-directional commands, OutTransferLength bytes were
                                transferred by OutDataBuffer.
  @retval EFI_NOT_READY         The SCSI Request Packet could not be sent because there are too many
                                SCSI Request Packets already queued. The caller may retry again later.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      A device error occurred while attempting to send the SCSI Request
                                Packet.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER Target, Lun, or the contents of ScsiRequestPacket are invalid.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The command described by the SCSI Request Packet is not supported
                                by the host adapter. This includes the case of Bi-directional SCSI
                                commands not supported by the implementation. The SCSI Request
                                Packet was not sent, so no additional status information is available.
  @retval EFI_TIMEOUT           A timeout occurred while waiting for the SCSI Request Packet to execute.
