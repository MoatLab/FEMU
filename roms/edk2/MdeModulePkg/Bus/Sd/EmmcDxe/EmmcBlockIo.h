/**
  Send a security protocol command to a device that receives data and/or the result
  of one or more commands sent by SendData.

  The ReceiveData function sends a security protocol command to the given MediaId.
  The security protocol command sent is defined by SecurityProtocolId and contains
  the security protocol specific data SecurityProtocolSpecificData. The function
  returns the data from the security protocol command in PayloadBuffer.

  For devices supporting the SCSI command set, the security protocol command is sent
  using the SECURITY PROTOCOL IN command defined in SPC-4.

  For devices supporting the ATA command set, the security protocol command is sent
  using one of the TRUSTED RECEIVE commands defined in ATA8-ACS if PayloadBufferSize
  is non-zero.

  If the PayloadBufferSize is zero, the security protocol command is sent using the
  Trusted Non-Data command defined in ATA8-ACS.

  If PayloadBufferSize is too small to store the available data from the security
  protocol command, the function shall copy PayloadBufferSize bytes into the
  PayloadBuffer and return EFI_WARN_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL.

  If PayloadBuffer or PayloadTransferSize is NULL and PayloadBufferSize is non-zero,
  the function shall return EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER.

  If the given MediaId does not support security protocol commands, the function shall
  return EFI_UNSUPPORTED. If there is no media in the device, the function returns
  EFI_NO_MEDIA. If the MediaId is not the ID for the current media in the device,
  the function returns EFI_MEDIA_CHANGED.

  If the security protocol fails to complete within the Timeout period, the function
  shall return EFI_TIMEOUT.

  If the security protocol command completes without an error, the function shall
  return EFI_SUCCESS. If the security protocol command completes with an error, the
  function shall return EFI_DEVICE_ERROR.

                                           of the security protocol command. A Timeout value of 0
                                           means that this function will wait indefinitely for the

                                           either implicit or explicit ownership of the buffer.
  @param[out] PayloadTransferSize          A pointer to a buffer to store the size in bytes of the

  @param[in]  IsRead                       Indicates it is a read or write operation.

  If PayloadBuffer is NULL and PayloadBufferSize is non-zero, the function shall

  If the given MediaId does not support security protocol commands, the function
  shall return EFI_UNSUPPORTED. If there is no media in the device, the function
  returns EFI_NO_MEDIA. If the MediaId is not the ID for the current media in the
  device, the function returns EFI_MEDIA_CHANGED.

  If the security protocol fails to complete within the Timeout period, the function
  shall return EFI_TIMEOUT.

  If the security protocol command completes without an error, the function shall return
  EFI_SUCCESS. If the security protocol command completes with an error, the function
  shall return EFI_DEVICE_ERROR.

  @param  This                         Indicates a pointer to the calling context.
  @param  MediaId                      ID of the medium to receive data from.
  @param  Timeout                      The timeout, in 100ns units, to use for the execution
                                       of the security protocol command. A Timeout value of 0
                                       means that this function will wait indefinitely for the
                                       security protocol command to execute. If Timeout is greater
                                       than zero, then this function will return EFI_TIMEOUT
                                       if the time required to execute the receive data command
                                       is greater than Timeout.
  @param  SecurityProtocolId           The value of the "Security Protocol" parameter of
                                       the security protocol command to be sent.
  @param  SecurityProtocolSpecificData The value of the "Security Protocol Specific" parameter
                                       of the security protocol command to be sent.
  @param  PayloadBufferSize            Size in bytes of the payload data buffer.
  @param  PayloadBuffer                A pointer to a destination buffer to store the security
                                       protocol command specific payload data for the security
                                       protocol command.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS                  The security protocol command completed successfully.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED              The given MediaId does not support security protocol commands.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR             The security protocol command completed with an error.
  @retval EFI_NO_MEDIA                 There is no media in the device.
  @retval EFI_MEDIA_CHANGED            The MediaId is not for the current media.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER        The PayloadBuffer is NULL and PayloadBufferSize is non-zero.
  @retval EFI_TIMEOUT                  A timeout occurred while waiting for the security
                                       protocol command to execute.
