      the block I/O interface. This enumeration will allow for policy decisions
      in the Recovery PEIM, such as "Try to recover from legacy floppy first,
      LS-120 second, CD-ROM third." If there are multiple partitions abstracted
      by a given device type, they should be reported in ascending order; this
      order also applies to nested partitions, such as legacy MBR, where the
      outermost partitions would have precedence in the reporting order. The
      same logic applies to systems such as IDE that have precedence relationships
      like "Master/Slave" or "Primary/Secondary". The master device should be
      reported first, the slave second.
