/**
  Retrieves a Unicode string that is the user readable name of the controller
  that is being managed by a driver.

  This function retrieves the user readable name of the controller specified by
  ControllerHandle and ChildHandle in the form of a Unicode string. If the
  driver specified by This has a user readable name in the language specified by
  Language, then a pointer to the controller name is returned in ControllerName,
  and EFI_SUCCESS is returned.  If the driver specified by This is not currently
  managing the controller specified by ControllerHandle and ChildHandle,
  then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is returned.  If the driver specified by This does not
  support the language specified by Language, then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is returned.

                                EFI_COMPONENT_NAME_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param  ControllerHandle      The handle of a controller that the driver
                                specified by This is managing.  This handle
