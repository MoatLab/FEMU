      the block I/O interface. This enumeration will allow for policy decisions
      in the Recovery PEIM, such as "Try to recover from legacy floppy first,
      LS-120 second, CD-ROM third." If there are multiple partitions abstracted
      by a given device type, they should be reported in ascending order; this
      order also applies to nested partitions, such as legacy MBR, where the
      outermost partitions would have precedence in the reporting order. The

  Reads the requested number of blocks from the specified block device.

  The function reads the requested number of blocks from the device. All the
  blocks are read, or an error is returned. If there is no media in the device,
  the function returns EFI_NO_MEDIA.

  @param[in]  PeiServices   General-purpose services that are available to
                            every PEIM.
  @param[in]  This          Indicates the EFI_PEI_RECOVERY_BLOCK_IO2_PPI instance.
  @param[in]  DeviceIndex   Specifies the block device to which the function wants
                            to talk. Because the driver that implements Block I/O
                            PPIs will manage multiple block devices, PPIs that
                            want to talk to a single device must specify the device
                            index that was assigned during the enumeration process.
                            This index is a number from one to NumberBlockDevices.
  @param[in]  StartLBA      The starting logical block address (LBA) to read from
                            on the device
  @param[in]  BufferSize    The size of the Buffer in bytes. This number must be
                            a multiple of the intrinsic block size of the device.
  @param[out] Buffer        A pointer to the destination buffer for the data.

                            buffer.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             The data was read correctly from the device.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR        The device reported an error while attempting
                                  to perform the read operation.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   The read request contains LBAs that are not
                                  valid, or the buffer is not properly aligned.
  @retval EFI_NO_MEDIA            There is no media in the device.
  @retval EFI_BAD_BUFFER_SIZE     The BufferSize parameter is not a multiple of
                                  the intrinsic block size of the device.
