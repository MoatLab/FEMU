  Trust transfer data from/to NVM Express device.

  This function performs one NVMe transaction to do a trust transfer from/to NVM
  Express device.

  @param[in]     Private           The pointer to the PEI_NVME_CONTROLLER_PRIVATE_DATA
                                   data structure.
  @param[in,out] Buffer            The pointer to the current transaction buffer.
  @param[in]     SecurityProtocolId
                                   The value of the "Security Protocol" parameter
                                   of the security protocol command to be sent.
  @param[in]     SecurityProtocolSpecificData
                                   The value of the "Security Protocol Specific"
                                   parameter of the security protocol command to
                                   be sent.
  @param[in]     TransferLength    The block number or sector count of the transfer.
  @param[in]     IsTrustSend       Indicates whether it is a trust send operation
                                   or not.
  @param[in]     Timeout           The timeout, in 100ns units, to use for the
                                   execution of the security protocol command.
                                   A Timeout value of 0 means that this function
                                   will wait indefinitely for the security protocol
                                   command to execute. If Timeout is greater than
                                   zero, then this function will return EFI_TIMEOUT
                                   if the time required to execute the receive
                                   data command is greater than Timeout.
  @param[out]    TransferLengthOut A pointer to a buffer to store the size in bytes
                                   of the data written to the buffer. Ignore it
                                   when IsTrustSend is TRUE.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS    The data transfer is complete successfully.
  @return others         Some error occurs when transferring data.

/**
  Send a security protocol command to a device that receives data and/or the result
  of one or more commands sent by SendData.

  The ReceiveData function sends a security protocol command to the given DeviceIndex.
  The security protocol command sent is defined by SecurityProtocolId and contains
  the security protocol specific data SecurityProtocolSpecificData. The function
  returns the data from the security protocol command in PayloadBuffer.

  For devices supporting the SCSI command set, the security protocol command is sent
  using the SECURITY PROTOCOL IN command defined in SPC-4.

  For devices supporting the ATA command set, the security protocol command is sent
  using one of the TRUSTED RECEIVE commands defined in ATA8-ACS if PayloadBufferSize
  is non-zero.

  If the PayloadBufferSize is zero, the security protocol command is sent using the
  Trusted Non-Data command defined in ATA8-ACS.

  If PayloadBufferSize is too small to store the available data from the security
  protocol command, the function shall copy PayloadBufferSize bytes into the
  PayloadBuffer and return EFI_WARN_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL.

  If PayloadBuffer or PayloadTransferSize is NULL and PayloadBufferSize is non-zero,
  the function shall return EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER.

  If the given DeviceIndex does not support security protocol commands, the function
  shall return EFI_UNSUPPORTED.

  If the security protocol fails to complete within the Timeout period, the function
  shall return EFI_TIMEOUT.

  If the security protocol command completes without an error, the function shall
  return EFI_SUCCESS. If the security protocol command completes with an error, the
  function shall return EFI_DEVICE_ERROR.

  @param[in]  This             The PPI instance pointer.
  @param[in]  DeviceIndex      Specifies the storage security device to which the
                               function wants to talk. Because the driver that
                               implements Storage Security Command PPIs will manage
                               multiple storage devices, the PPIs that want to talk
                               to a single device must specify the device index
                               that was assigned during the enumeration process.
                               This index is a number from one to NumberofDevices.

                               of the security protocol command. A Timeout value
                               of 0 means that this function will wait indefinitely
                               for the security protocol command to execute. If
                               Timeout is greater than zero, then this function
                               will return EFI_TIMEOUT if the time required to
                               execute the receive data command is greater than
                               Timeout.
  @param[in]  SecurityProtocolId
                               The value of the "Security Protocol" parameter of
                               the security protocol command to be sent.
  @param[in]  SecurityProtocolSpecificData

                               for the security protocol command. The caller is

                               ownership of the buffer.
  @param[out] PayloadTransferSize
                               A pointer to a buffer to store the size in bytes
                               of the data written to the payload data buffer.

                                       store the available data from the device.
                                       The PayloadBuffer contains the truncated

                                       with an error.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER        The PayloadBuffer or PayloadTransferSize

  The SendData function sends a security protocol command containing the payload
  PayloadBuffer to the given DeviceIndex. The security protocol command sent is

  SecurityProtocolSpecificData. If the underlying protocol command requires a
