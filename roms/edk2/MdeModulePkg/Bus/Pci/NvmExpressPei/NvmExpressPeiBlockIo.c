      The MediaInfo structure describes an enumeration of possible block device
      types.  This enumeration exists because no device paths are actually passed
      across interfaces that describe the type or class of hardware that is publishing
      the block I/O interface. This enumeration will allow for policy decisions
      in the Recovery PEIM, such as "Try to recover from legacy floppy first,
      LS-120 second, CD-ROM third." If there are multiple partitions abstracted
      by a given device type, they should be reported in ascending order; this
      order also applies to nested partitions, such as legacy MBR, where the
      outermost partitions would have precedence in the reporting order. The
      same logic applies to systems such as IDE that have precedence relationships
      like "Master/Slave" or "Primary/Secondary". The master device should be
      reported first, the slave second.

  @param[in]  StartLBA      The starting logical block address (LBA) to read from
                            on the device
  @param[in]  BufferSize    The size of the Buffer in bytes. This number must be
                            a multiple of the intrinsic block size of the device.
  @param[out] Buffer        A pointer to the destination buffer for the data.
                            The caller is responsible for the ownership of the
                            buffer.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             The data was read correctly from the device.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR        The device reported an error while attempting
                                  to perform the read operation.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   The read request contains LBAs that are not
                                  valid, or the buffer is not properly aligned.
  @retval EFI_NO_MEDIA            There is no media in the device.
  @retval EFI_BAD_BUFFER_SIZE     The BufferSize parameter is not a multiple of
                                  the intrinsic block size of the device.
