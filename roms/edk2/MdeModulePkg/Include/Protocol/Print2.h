/**
  Converts a decimal value to a Null-terminated Ascii string.

  Converts the decimal number specified by Value to a Null-terminated Ascii
  string specified by Buffer containing at most Width characters. No padding of
  spaces is ever performed. If Width is 0 then a width of
  MAXIMUM_VALUE_CHARACTERS is assumed. If the conversion contains more than
  Width characters, then only the first Width characters are placed in Buffer.
  Additional conversion parameters are specified in Flags.

  The Flags bit LEFT_JUSTIFY is always ignored.
  All conversions are left justified in Buffer.
  If Width is 0, PREFIX_ZERO is ignored in Flags.
  If COMMA_TYPE is set in Flags, then PREFIX_ZERO is ignored in Flags, and
  commas are inserted every 3rd digit starting from the right.
  If RADIX_HEX is set in Flags, then the output buffer will be formatted in
  hexadecimal format.
  If Value is < 0 and RADIX_HEX is not set in Flags, then the fist character in
  Buffer is a '-'.
  If PREFIX_ZERO is set in Flags and PREFIX_ZERO is not being ignored, then
  Buffer is padded with '0' characters so the combination of the optional '-'
  sign character, '0' characters, digit characters for Value, and the
  Null-terminator add up to Width characters.

  If an error would be returned, then the function will ASSERT().

  @param  Buffer      The pointer to the output buffer for the produced
                      Null-terminated Ascii string.
  @param  BufferSize  The size of Buffer in bytes, including the
                      Null-terminator.
  @param  Flags       The bitmask of flags that specify left justification,
                      zero pad, and commas.
  @param  Value       The 64-bit signed value to convert to a string.
  @param  Width       The maximum number of Ascii characters to place in
                      Buffer, not including the Null-terminator.

  @retval RETURN_SUCCESS           The decimal value is converted.
  @retval RETURN_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL  If BufferSize cannot hold the converted
                                   value.
  @retval RETURN_INVALID_PARAMETER If Buffer is NULL.
                                   If PcdMaximumAsciiStringLength is not
                                   zero, and BufferSize is greater than
                                   PcdMaximumAsciiStringLength.
                                   If unsupported bits are set in Flags.
                                   If both COMMA_TYPE and RADIX_HEX are set in
                                   Flags.
                                   If Width >= MAXIMUM_VALUE_CHARACTERS.
