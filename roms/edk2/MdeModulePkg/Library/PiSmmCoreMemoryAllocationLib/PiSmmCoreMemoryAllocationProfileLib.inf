# Memory Allocation/Profile Library instance dedicated to SMM Core.
# The implementation borrows the SMM Core Memory Allocation/Profile services as the primitive
# for memory allocation/profile instead of using SMM System Table servces or SMM memory profile protocol in an indirect way.
# It is assumed that this library instance must be linked with SMM Cre in this package.
