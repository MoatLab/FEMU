/**
  This service retrieves the number of logical processor in the platform
  and the number of those logical processors that are enabled on this boot.
  This service may only be called from the BSP.

  This function is used to retrieve the following information:
    - The number of logical processors that are present in the system.
    - The number of enabled logical processors in the system at the instant
      this call is made.

  Because MP Service Ppi provides services to enable and disable processors
  dynamically, the number of enabled logical processors may vary during the
  course of a boot session.

  If this service is called from an AP, then EFI_DEVICE_ERROR is returned.
  If NumberOfProcessors or NumberOfEnabledProcessors is NULL, then
  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned. Otherwise, the total number of processors
  is returned in NumberOfProcessors, the number of currently enabled processor
  is returned in NumberOfEnabledProcessors, and EFI_SUCCESS is returned.

/**
  This service executes a caller provided function on all enabled APs. APs can
  run either simultaneously or one at a time in sequence. This service supports
  both blocking requests only. This service may only
  be called from the BSP.

  This function is used to dispatch all the enabled APs to the function specified
  by Procedure.  If any enabled AP is busy, then EFI_NOT_READY is returned
  immediately and Procedure is not started on any AP.

  If SingleThread is TRUE, all the enabled APs execute the function specified by
  Procedure one by one, in ascending order of processor handle number. Otherwise,
  all the enabled APs execute the function specified by Procedure simultaneously.

  If the timeout specified by TimeoutInMicroSeconds expires before all APs return
  from Procedure, then Procedure on the failed APs is terminated. All enabled APs
  are always available for further calls to EFI_PEI_MP_SERVICES_PPI.StartupAllAPs()
  and EFI_PEI_MP_SERVICES_PPI.StartupThisAP(). If FailedCpuList is not NULL, its
  content points to the list of processor handle numbers in which Procedure was
  terminated.

  Note: It is the responsibility of the consumer of the EFI_PEI_MP_SERVICES_PPI.StartupAllAPs()
  to make sure that the nature of the code that is executed on the BSP and the
  dispatched APs is well controlled. The MP Services Ppi does not guarantee
  that the Procedure function is MP-safe. Hence, the tasks that can be run in
  parallel are limited to certain independent tasks and well-controlled exclusive
  code. PEI services and Ppis may not be called by APs unless otherwise
  specified.

  In blocking execution mode, BSP waits until all APs finish or
  TimeoutInMicroSeconds expires.
