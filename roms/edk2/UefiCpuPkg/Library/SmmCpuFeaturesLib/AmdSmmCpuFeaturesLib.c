  This function updates the SMRAM save state on the currently executing CPU

  the RSM instruction resumes and update the resume execution address with
  either NewInstructionPointer32 or NewInstructionPoint.  The auto HALT restart

  the value of the instruction pointer from the SMRAM save state that was
  replaced.  If this function returns 0, then the SMRAM save state was not
  modified.
