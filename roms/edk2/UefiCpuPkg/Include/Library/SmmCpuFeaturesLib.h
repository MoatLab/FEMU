  Called during the very first SMI into System Management Mode to initialize
  CPU features, including SMBASE, for the currently executing CPU.  Since this
  is the first SMI, the SMRAM Save State Map is at the default address of
  SMM_DEFAULT_SMBASE + SMRAM_SAVE_STATE_MAP_OFFSET.  The currently executing
  CPU is specified by CpuIndex and CpuIndex can be used to access information
  about the currently executing CPU in the ProcessorInfo array and the
  HotPlugCpuData data structure.

  @param[in] CpuIndex        The index of the CPU to initialize.  The value
                             must be between 0 and the NumberOfCpus field in

/**
  This function updates the SMRAM save state on the currently executing CPU

  function must evaluate the SMRAM save state to determine the execution mode
  the RSM instruction resumes and update the resume execution address with
  either NewInstructionPointer32 or NewInstructionPoint.  The auto HALT restart
  flag in the SMRAM save state must always be cleared.  This function returns
  the value of the instruction pointer from the SMRAM save state that was
  replaced.  If this function returns 0, then the SMRAM save state was not
  modified.

  This function is called during the very first SMI on each CPU after
  SmmCpuFeaturesInitializeProcessor() to set a flag in normal execution mode

  SMBASE address is used for the first SMI to the next CPU.
