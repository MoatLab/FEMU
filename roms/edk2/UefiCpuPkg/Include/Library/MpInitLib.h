  @param[in]  SingleThread            If TRUE, then all the enabled APs execute

                                      blocking or non-blocking mode. Zero means
                                      infinity.  If the timeout expires before
                                      all APs return from Procedure, then Procedure
                                      on the failed APs is terminated. All enabled

                                      The buffer is allocated by MP Initialization
                                      library, and it's the caller's responsibility to
                                      free the buffer with FreePool() service.
                                      In blocking mode, it is ready for consumption
                                      when the call returns. In non-blocking mode,
                                      it is ready when WaitEvent is signaled.  The
                                      list of failed CPU is terminated by
