  Reads memory-mapped registers.

  The I/O operations are carried out exactly as requested. The caller is responsible
  for satisfying any alignment and I/O width restrictions that a PI System on a
  platform might require. For example on some platforms, width requests of
  EfiCpuIoWidthUint64 do not work. Misaligned buffers, on the other hand, will
  be handled by the driver.

  If Width is EfiCpuIoWidthUint8, EfiCpuIoWidthUint16, EfiCpuIoWidthUint32,
  or EfiCpuIoWidthUint64, then both Address and Buffer are incremented for
  each of the Count operations that is performed.

  If Width is EfiCpuIoWidthFifoUint8, EfiCpuIoWidthFifoUint16,
  EfiCpuIoWidthFifoUint32, or EfiCpuIoWidthFifoUint64, then only Buffer is
  incremented for each of the Count operations that is performed. The read or
  write operation is performed Count times on the same Address.

  If Width is EfiCpuIoWidthFillUint8, EfiCpuIoWidthFillUint16,
  EfiCpuIoWidthFillUint32, or EfiCpuIoWidthFillUint64, then only Address is
  incremented for each of the Count operations that is performed. The read or
  write operation is performed Count times from the first element of Buffer.

  @param[in]  This     A pointer to the EFI_CPU_IO2_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in]  Width    Signifies the width of the I/O or Memory operation.
  @param[in]  Address  The base address of the I/O operation.
  @param[in]  Count    The number of I/O operations to perform. The number of
                       bytes moved is Width size * Count, starting at Address.
  @param[out] Buffer   For read operations, the destination buffer to store the results.
                       For write operations, the source buffer from which to write data.
