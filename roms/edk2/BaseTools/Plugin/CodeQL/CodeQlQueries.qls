# Specifically hide the results of these.
#
# The following rules have been evaluated and explicitly not included for the following reasons:
#   - `cpp/allocation-too-small` - Appears to be hardcoded for C standard library functions `malloc`, `calloc`,
#     `realloc`, so it consumes time without much value with custom allocation functions in the codebase.
#   - `cpp/commented-out-code` - Triggers often. Needs further review.
#   - `cpp/duplicate-include-guard` - The <Phase>EntryPoint.h files includes a common include guard value
#     `__MODULE_ENTRY_POINT_H__`. This was the only occurrence found. So not very useful.
#   - `cpp/invalid-pointer-deref` - Very limited results with what appear to be false positives.
#   - `cpp/use-of-goto` - Goto is valid and allowed in the codebase.
#   - `cpp/useless-expression` - Triggers too often on cases where a NULL lib implementation is provided for a function.
#     Because the implementation simply returns, the check considers it useless.
#   - `cpp/weak-crypto/*` - Crypto algorithms are tracked outside CodeQL.
