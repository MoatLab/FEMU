/**
  This function will return the leaf signer certificate in a chain.  This is
  required because certificate chains are not guaranteed to have the
  certificates in the order that they were issued.

  A typical certificate chain looks like this:


                 ----------------------------
                |            Root            |
                 ----------------------------
                               ^
                               |
                 ----------------------------
                |          Policy CA         | <-- Typical Trust Anchor.
                 ----------------------------

                               |
                 ----------------------------

                               |

/**
  This function receives a PKCS#7 formatted signature blob,
  looks for the EKU SEQUENCE blob, and if found then looks
  for all the required EKUs. This function was created so that
  the Surface team can cut down on the number of Certificate
  Authorities (CA's) by checking EKU's on leaf signers for
  a specific product. This prevents one product's certificate
  from signing another product's firmware or unlock blobs.

  Note that this function does not validate the certificate chain.
  That needs to be done before using this function.

  @param[in]  Pkcs7Signature       The PKCS#7 signed information content block. An array
                                   containing the content block with both the signature,
                                   the signer's certificate, and any necessary intermediate
                                   certificates.
  @param[in]  Pkcs7SignatureSize   Number of bytes in Pkcs7Signature.
  @param[in]  RequiredEKUs         Array of null-terminated strings listing OIDs of
                                   required EKUs that must be present in the signature.
  @param[in]  RequiredEKUsSize     Number of elements in the RequiredEKUs string array.
  @param[in]  RequireAllPresent    If this is TRUE, then all of the specified EKU's
                                   must be present in the leaf signer.  If it is
                                   FALSE, then we will succeed if we find any
                                   of the specified EKU's.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS              The required EKUs were found in the signature.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER    A parameter was invalid.
  @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND            One or more EKU's were not found in the signature.
