                             Introduction
=============================================================================
  OpenSSL is a well-known open source implementation of SSL/TLS protocols.
The core library implements the cryptographic and SSL/TLS functions and
also provides various utility functions. The OpenSSL library is widely used
in variety of security products development as base crypto provider.
(See http://www.openssl.org/ for more information about OpenSSL).
  UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is a specification detailing
the interfaces between OS and platform firmware. Several security features
were introduced (e.g. Authenticated Variable Service, Driver Signing, etc)
from UEFI 2.2 (http://www.uefi.org/). These security features highly depend
on the cryptography.
  This HOWTO documents OpenSSL building under UEFI/EDKII environment.

                             OpenSSL-Version
=============================================================================
  EDKII supports building with the latest release of OpenSSL.
  NOTE: Only latest release version was fully validated.
        And no guarantees on build & functionality if using other versions.

                      HOW to Install OpenSSL for UEFI Building
=============================================================================
  OpenSSL repository was added as one submodule of EDKII project. Please
refer to edk2/Readme.md for how to clone the code.

                      About process_files.pl
=============================================================================
  "process_files.pl" is one Perl script which runs the OpenSSL Configure,
then processes the resulting file list into our local OpensslLib.inf and
OpensslLibCrypto.inf.
  This only needs to be done once by the maintainer / developer when
updating to a new version of OpenSSL (or changing options, etc.).
Normal users do not need do this, since the results are already stored in
the EDKII git repository for them.
