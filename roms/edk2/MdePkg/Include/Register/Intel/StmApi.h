/**
  Since the normal OS environment runs with a different set of page tables than
  the SMM guest, virtual mappings will certainly be different. In order to do a
  guest virtual to host physical translation of an address from the normal OS
  code (EIP for example), it is necessary to walk the page tables governing the
  OS page mappings. Since the SMM guest has no direct access to the page tables,
  it must ask the STM to do this page table walk. This is supported via the
  StmAddressLookup VMCALL. All OS page table formats need to be supported,
  (e.g. PAE, PSE, Intel64, EPT, etc.)

  StmAddressLookup takes a CR3 value and a virtual address from the interrupted
  code as input and returns the corresponding physical address. It also
  optionally maps the physical address into the SMM guest's virtual address
  space. This new mapping persists ONLY for the duration of the SMI and if
  needed in subsequent SMIs it must be remapped. PAT cache types follow the
  interrupted environment's page table.

  If EPT is enabled, OS CR3 only provides guest physical address information,
  but the SMM guest might also need to know the host physical address. Since
  SMM does not have direct access rights to EPT (it is protected by the STM),
  SMM can input InterruptedEptp to let STM help to walk through it, and output
  the host physical address.

/**
  When returning from a protection exception (see section 6.2), the SMM guest
  can instruct the STM to take one of two paths. It can either request a value
  be logged to the TXT.ERRORCODE register and subsequently reset the machine
  (indicating it couldn't resolve the problem), or it can request that the STM
  resume the SMM guest again with the specified register state.

  Unlike other VMCALL interfaces, StmReturnFromProtectionException behaves more
  like a jump or an IRET instruction than a "call". It does not return directly
  to the caller, but indirectly to a different location specified on the
  caller's stack (see section 6.2) or not at all.

  If the SMM guest STM protection exception handler itself causes a protection
  exception (e.g. a single nested exception), or more than 100 un-nested
  exceptions occur within the scope of a single SMI event, the STM must write
  STM_CRASH_PROTECTION_EXCEPTION_FAILURE to the TXT.ERRORCODE register and
  assert TXT.CMD.SYS_RESET. The reason for these restrictions is to simplify
  the code requirements while still enabling a reasonable debugging capability.

  @param  EAX  #STM_API_RETURN_FROM_PROTECTION_EXCEPTION (0x00000004)
  @param  EBX  If 0, resume SMM guest using register state found on exception
               stack.  If in range 0x01..0x0F, EBX contains a BIOS error code
               which the STM must record in the TXT.ERRORCODE register and
               subsequently reset the system via TXT.CMD.SYS_RESET. The value
               of the TXT.ERRORCODE register is calculated as follows:

                 TXT.ERRORCODE = (EBX & 0x0F) | STM_CRASH_BIOS_PANIC

               Values 0x10..0xFFFFFFFF are reserved, do not use.

  VMCALL API Numbers
  API number convention: MLE facing VMCALL interfaces have bit 16 set.

  The STM configuration lifecycle is as follows:
    1. SENTER->SINIT->MLE: MLE begins execution with SMI disabled (masked).
    2. MLE invokes #STM_API_INITIALIZE_PROTECTION VMCALL to prepare STM for
       setup of initial protection profile. This is done on a single CPU and
       has global effect.
    3. MLE invokes #STM_API_PROTECT_RESOURCE VMCALL to define the initial
       protection profile. The protection profile is global across all CPUs.
    4. MLE invokes #STM_API_START VMCALL to enable the STM to begin receiving
       SMI events. This must be done on every logical CPU.
    5. MLE may invoke #STM_API_PROTECT_RESOURCE VMCALL or
       #STM_API_UNPROTECT_RESOURCE VMCALL during runtime as many times as
       necessary.
    6. MLE invokes #STM_API_STOP VMCALL to disable the STM. SMI is again masked
       following #STM_API_STOP VMCALL.

  StartStmVmcall() is used to configure an STM that is present in MSEG. SMIs

  enabled and the STM has been started and is active. Prior to invoking
  StartStmVMCALL(), the MLE root should first invoke
  InitializeProtectionVMCALL() followed by as many iterations of
  ProtectResourceVMCALL() as necessary to establish the initial protection
  profile.  StartStmVmcall() must be invoked on all processor threads.

  InitializeProtectionVMCALL() prepares the STM for setup of the initial

  invocations of ProtectResourceVMCALL(), prior to invoking StartStmVMCALL().
  It is only necessary to invoke InitializeProtectionVMCALL() on one processor
  thread.  InitializeProtectionVMCALL() does not alter whether SMIs are masked
  or unmasked. The STM should return back to the MLE with "Blocking by SMI" set
  to 1 in the GUEST_INTERRUPTIBILITY field for the VMCS the STM created for the
  MLE guest.

                No error, EAX set to STM_SUCCESS, EBX bits set to indicate STM
                capabilities as defined below. The STM has set up an empty
                protection profile, except for the resources that it sets up to
                protect itself. The STM must not allow the SMI handler to map
                any pages from the MSEG Base to the top of TSEG. The STM must
                also not allow SMI handler access to those MSRs which the STM
                requires for its own protection.

                resource list contains memory pages in MSEG.
