  MSR Definitions for Intel processors based on the Skylake/Kabylake/Coffeelake/Cannonlake microarchitecture.

  Provides defines for Machine Specific Registers(MSR) indexes. Data structures
  are provided for MSRs that contain one or more bit fields.  If the MSR value
  returned is a single 32-bit or 64-bit value, then a data structure is not
  provided for that MSR.
