// Conversion functions
//
// There are three reasons for having conversion functions:
//
// 1. We are converting from a signed type to an unsigned type of the same
//    size, or vice-versa.
//
// 2. We are converting to a smaller type, and we could therefore possibly
//    overflow.
//
// 3. We are converting to a bigger type, and we are signed and the type we are
//    converting to is unsigned.

/**
  INT8 -> UINT8 conversion

  Converts the value specified by Operand to a value specified by Result type
  and stores the converted value into the caller allocated output buffer
  specified by Result.  The caller must pass in a Result buffer that is at
  least as large as the Result type.

  If Result is NULL, RETURN_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned.

  If the conversion results in an overflow or an underflow condition, then
  Result is set to UINT8_ERROR and RETURN_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL is returned.

// Signed operations

// Strongly consider using unsigned numbers.
//
// Signed numbers are often used where unsigned numbers should be used.
// For example file sizes and array indices should always be unsigned.
// Subtracting a larger positive signed number from a smaller positive
// signed number with SafeInt32Sub will succeed, producing a negative number,
// that then must not be used as an array index (but can occasionally be
// used as a pointer index.) Similarly for adding a larger magnitude
// negative number to a smaller magnitude positive number.
//
// This library does not protect you from such errors. It tells you if your
// integer operations overflowed, not if you are doing the right thing
// with your non-overflowed integers.
//
// Likewise you can overflow a buffer with a non-overflowed unsigned index.

  Result buffer that is at least as large as the Result type.

  If Result is NULL, RETURN_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned.

  If the requested operation results in an overflow or an underflow condition,
  then Result is set to INT64_ERROR and RETURN_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL is returned.
