  Communicates with a registered handler.

  This function provides a service to send and receive messages from a registered UEFI service.

  @param[in] This                     The EFI_MM_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in, out] CommBufferPhysical  Physical address of the MM communication buffer
  @param[in, out] CommBufferVirtual   Virtual address of the MM communication buffer
  @param[in, out] CommSize            The size of the data buffer being passed in. On exit, the
                                      size of data being returned. Zero if the handler does not
                                      wish to reply with any data. This parameter is optional
                                      and may be NULL.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS            The message was successfully posted.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  CommBufferPhysical was NULL or CommBufferVirtual was NULL.
  @retval EFI_BAD_BUFFER_SIZE    The buffer is too large for the MM implementation.
                                 If this error is returned, the MessageLength field
                                 in the CommBuffer header or the integer pointed by
                                 CommSize, are updated to reflect the maximum payload
                                 size the implementation can accommodate.
  @retval EFI_ACCESS_DENIED      The CommunicateBuffer parameter or CommSize parameter,
                                 if not omitted, are in address range that cannot be
                                 accessed by the MM environment.
