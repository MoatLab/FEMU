// PCI Segment Library that layers on top of the PCI Root Bridge I/O Protocol.

// This library produces the APIs from the PCI Library and implements these APIs
// by calling into the PCI Root Bridge I/O Protocols that are present in the platform.
// The PCI Root Bridge I/O Protocols are typically produced by a chipset specific DXE driver.
// This library binds to all of the PCI Root Bridge I/O Protocols in the platform and handles
// the translation from a PCI segment number into a specific PCI Root Bridge I/O Protocol.
