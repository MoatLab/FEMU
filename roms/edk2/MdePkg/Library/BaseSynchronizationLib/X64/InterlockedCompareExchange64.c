/**
  Performs an atomic compare exchange operation on a 64-bit unsigned integer.

  Performs an atomic compare exchange operation on the 64-bit unsigned integer specified
  by Value.  If Value is equal to CompareValue, then Value is set to ExchangeValue and
  CompareValue is returned.  If Value is not equal to CompareValue, then Value is returned.
  The compare exchange operation must be performed using MP safe mechanisms.

  @param  Value         A pointer to the 64-bit value for the compare exchange
                        operation.
  @param  CompareValue  64-bit value used in compare operation.
  @param  ExchangeValue 64-bit value used in exchange operation.

  @return The original *Value before exchange.
