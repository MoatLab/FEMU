## @file
#  Instance of RNG (Random Number Generator) Library.
#
#  BaseRng Library that uses the TimerLib to provide reasonably random numbers.
#  Do NOT use this on a production system as this uses the system performance
#  counter rather than a true source of random in addition to having a weak
#  random algorithm. This is provided primarily as a source of entropy for
#  OpenSSL for platforms that do not have a good built in RngLib as this
#  emulates what was done before (though it isn't perfect).
