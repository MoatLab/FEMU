  INT32 -> UINTN conversion

  Converts the value specified by Operand to a value specified by Result type
  and stores the converted value into the caller allocated output buffer
  specified by Result.  The caller must pass in a Result buffer that is at
  least as large as the Result type.

  If Result is NULL, RETURN_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned.

  If the conversion results in an overflow or an underflow condition, then
  Result is set to UINTN_ERROR and RETURN_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL is returned.
