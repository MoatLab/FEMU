# PCI Library that layers on top of the SMM PCI Root Bridge I/O Protocol.
#
# This library produces the APIs from the PCI Library and implements these APIs
#  by calling into SMM PCI Root Bridge I/O Protocol. SMM PCI Root Bridge I/O Protocol is
#  typically produced by a chipset specific SMM driver.
#  This library binds to the first SMM PCI Root Bridge I/O Protocol in the platform. As a result,
#  it should only be used on platforms that contain a single PCI root bridge.
