  Disables the 64-bit paging mode on the CPU.

  Disables the 64-bit paging mode on the CPU and returns to 32-bit protected
  mode. This function assumes the current execution mode is 64-paging mode.
  This function is only available on x64. After the 64-bit paging mode is
  disabled, control is transferred to the function specified by EntryPoint
  using the new stack specified by NewStack and passing in the parameters
  specified by Context1 and Context2. Context1 and Context2 are optional and
  may be 0. The function EntryPoint must never return.

  @param  CodeSelector  The 16-bit selector to load in the CS before EntryPoint
                        is called. The descriptor in the GDT that this selector
                        references must be setup for 32-bit protected mode.
  @param  EntryPoint    The 64-bit virtual address of the function to call with
                        the new stack after paging is disabled.
  @param  Context1      The 64-bit virtual address of the context to pass into
                        the EntryPoint function as the first parameter after
                        paging is disabled.
  @param  Context2      The 64-bit virtual address of the context to pass into
                        the EntryPoint function as the second parameter after
                        paging is disabled.
  @param  NewStack      The 64-bit virtual address of the new stack to use for
                        the EntryPoint function after paging is disabled.
