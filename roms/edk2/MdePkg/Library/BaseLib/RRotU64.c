/**
  Rotates a 64-bit integer right between 0 and 63 bits, filling the high bits
  with the high low bits that were rotated.

  This function rotates the 64-bit value Operand to the right by Count bits.
  The high Count bits are fill with the low Count bits of Operand. The rotated
  value is returned.

  If Count is greater than 63, then ASSERT().

  @param  Operand The 64-bit operand to rotate right.
  @param  Count   The number of bits to rotate right.

  @return Operand >> Count.
