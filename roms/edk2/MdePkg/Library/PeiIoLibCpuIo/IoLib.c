  Writes a 64-bit MMIO register.

  Writes the 64-bit MMIO register specified by Address with the value specified
  by Value and returns Value. This function must guarantee that all MMIO read
  and write operations are serialized.

  If 64-bit MMIO register operations are not supported, then ASSERT().
  If Address is not aligned on a 64-bit boundary, then ASSERT().

  @param  Address The MMIO register to write.
  @param  Value   The value to write to the MMIO register.
