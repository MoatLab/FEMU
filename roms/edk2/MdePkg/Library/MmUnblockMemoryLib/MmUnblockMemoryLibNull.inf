#  Null instance of MM Unblock Page Library.
#
#  This library provides an interface to request non-MMRAM pages to be mapped/unblocked
#  from inside MM environment.
#
#  For MM modules that need to access regions outside of MMRAMs, the agents that set up
#  these regions are responsible for invoking this API in order for these memory areas
#  to be accessed from inside MM.
