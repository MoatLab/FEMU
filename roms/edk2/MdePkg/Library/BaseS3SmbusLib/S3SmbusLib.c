/**
  Saves an SMBus operation to S3 script to be replayed on S3 resume.

  This function provides a standard way to save SMBus operation to S3 boot Script.
  The data can either be of the Length byte, word, or a block of data.
  If it falis to save S3 boot script, then ASSERT ().

  @param  SmbusOperation  Signifies which particular SMBus hardware protocol instance that it will use to
                          execute the SMBus transactions.
  @param  SmBusAddress    Address that encodes the SMBUS Slave Address,
                          SMBUS Command, SMBUS Data Length, and PEC.
  @param  Length          Signifies the number of bytes that this operation will do. The maximum number of
                          bytes can be revision specific and operation specific.
  @param  Buffer          Contains the value of data to execute to the SMBus slave device. Not all operations
                          require this argument. The length of this buffer is identified by Length.
