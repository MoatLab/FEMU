#  Serial Port Library backed by SBI console.
#
#  Meant for SEC and PEI (XIP) environments.
#
#  Due to limitations of SBI console interface and XIP environments
#  (on use of globals), this library instance does not implement reading
#  and polling the serial port. See PrePiDxeSerialPortLibRiscVSbiRam.inf
#  for the full-featured variant meant for PrePi and DXE environments.
