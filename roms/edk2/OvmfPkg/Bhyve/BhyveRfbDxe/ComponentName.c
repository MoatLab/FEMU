  returned in DriverName, and EFI_SUCCESS is returned. If the driver specified

/**
  Retrieves a Unicode string that is the user readable name of the controller
  that is being managed by a driver.

  This function retrieves the user readable name of the controller specified by
  ControllerHandle and ChildHandle in the form of a Unicode string. If the
  driver specified by This has a user readable name in the language specified by
  Language, then a pointer to the controller name is returned in ControllerName,
  and EFI_SUCCESS is returned.  If the driver specified by This is not currently
  managing the controller specified by ControllerHandle and ChildHandle,
  then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is returned.  If the driver specified by This does not
  support the language specified by Language, then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is returned.

  @param  This[in]              A pointer to the EFI_COMPONENT_NAME2_PROTOCOL or
                                EFI_COMPONENT_NAME_PROTOCOL instance.

  @param  ControllerHandle[in]  The handle of a controller that the driver
                                specified by This is managing.  This handle
                                specifies the controller whose name is to be
                                returned.

  @param  ChildHandle[in]       The handle of the child controller to retrieve
                                the name of.  This is an optional parameter that
                                may be NULL.  It will be NULL for device
                                drivers.  It will also be NULL for a bus drivers
                                that wish to retrieve the name of the bus
                                controller.  It will not be NULL for a bus
                                driver that wishes to retrieve the name of a

                                language of the driver name that the caller is
                                requesting, and it must match one of the
                                languages specified in SupportedLanguages. The
                                number of languages supported by a driver is up
                                to the driver writer. Language is specified in
                                RFC 4646 or ISO 639-2 language code format.

  @param  ControllerName[out]   A pointer to the Unicode string to return.
                                This Unicode string is the name of the
                                controller specified by ControllerHandle and
                                ChildHandle in the language specified by
                                Language from the point of view of the driver
                                specified by This.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The Unicode string for the user readable name in

                                driver specified by This was returned in
