/**
  Lower the task priority back to the value at which the interrupt
  occurred.

  This is unfortunately messy.  UEFI requires us to support nested
  interrupts, but provides no way for an interrupt handler to call
  RestoreTPL() without implicitly re-enabling interrupts.  In a
  virtual machine, it is possible for a large burst of interrupts to
  arrive.  We must prevent such a burst from leading to stack
  exhaustion, while continuing to allow nested interrupts to occur.

  Since nested interrupts are permitted, an interrupt handler may be
  invoked as an inner interrupt handler while an outer instance of the
  same interrupt handler is still inside its call to RestoreTPL().

  To avoid stack exhaustion, this call may therefore (when provably
  safe to do so) defer the actual TPL lowering to be performed by an
  outer instance of the same interrupt handler.

  @param InterruptedTPL        The task priority level at which the interrupt
                               occurred, as previously returned from

  @param SystemContext         A pointer to the system context when the
                               interrupt occurred.

  @param IsrState              A pointer to the state shared between all
                               invocations of the nested interrupt handler.
