/*
 * Feature and Parameter Negotiation
 * =================================
 * The two halves of a Xen block driver utilize nodes within the XenStore to
 * communicate capabilities and to negotiate operating parameters.  This
 * section enumerates these nodes which reside in the respective front and
 * backend portions of the XenStore, following the XenBus convention.
 *
 * All data in the XenStore is stored as strings.  Nodes specifying numeric
 * values are encoded in decimal.  Integer value ranges listed below are
 * expressed as fixed sized integer types capable of storing the conversion
 * of a properly formatted node string, without loss of information.
 *
 * Any specified default value is in effect if the corresponding XenBus node
 * is not present in the XenStore.
 *
 * XenStore nodes in sections marked "PRIVATE" are solely for use by the
 * driver side whose XenBus tree contains them.
 *
 * XenStore nodes marked "DEPRECATED" in their notes section should only be
 * used to provide interoperability with legacy implementations.
 *
 * See the XenBus state transition diagram below for details on when XenBus
 * nodes must be published and when they can be queried.

 *****************************************************************************
 *
 *------------------ Backend Device Identification (PRIVATE) ------------------
 *
 * mode
 *      Values:         "r" (read only), "w" (writable)
 *
 *      The read or write access permissions to the backing store to be
 *      granted to the frontend.
 *
 * params
 *      Values:         string
 *
 *      A free formatted string providing sufficient information for the
 *      backend driver to open the backing device.  (e.g. the path to the
 *      file or block device representing the backing store.)
 *
 * type
 *      Values:         "file", "phy", "tap"
 *
 *      The type of the backing device/object.
 *
 *--------------------------------- Features ---------------------------------
 *
 * feature-barrier
 *      Values:         0/1 (boolean)
 *      Default Value:  0
 *
 *      A value of "1" indicates that the backend can process requests
 *      containing the BLKIF_OP_WRITE_BARRIER request opcode.  Requests
 *      of this type may still be returned at any time with the
 *      BLKIF_RSP_EOPNOTSUPP result code.
 *
 * feature-flush-cache
 *      Values:         0/1 (boolean)
 *      Default Value:  0
 *
 *      A value of "1" indicates that the backend can process requests
 *      containing the BLKIF_OP_FLUSH_DISKCACHE request opcode.  Requests
 *      of this type may still be returned at any time with the
 *      BLKIF_RSP_EOPNOTSUPP result code.
 *
 * feature-discard
 *      Values:         0/1 (boolean)
 *      Default Value:  0
 *
 *      A value of "1" indicates that the backend can process requests
 *      containing the BLKIF_OP_DISCARD request opcode.  Requests
 *      of this type may still be returned at any time with the
 *      BLKIF_RSP_EOPNOTSUPP result code.
 *
 * feature-persistent
 *      Values:         0/1 (boolean)
 *      Default Value:  0
 *      Notes: 7
 *
 *      A value of "1" indicates that the backend can keep the grants used
 *      by the frontend driver mapped, so the same set of grants should be
 *      used in all transactions. The maximum number of grants the backend
 *      can map persistently depends on the implementation, but ideally it
 *      should be RING_SIZE * BLKIF_MAX_SEGMENTS_PER_REQUEST. Using this
 *      feature the backend doesn't need to unmap each grant, preventing
 *      costly TLB flushes. The backend driver should only map grants
 *      persistently if the frontend supports it. If a backend driver chooses
 *      to use the persistent protocol when the frontend doesn't support it,
 *      it will probably hit the maximum number of persistently mapped grants
 *      (due to the fact that the frontend won't be reusing the same grants),
 *      and fall back to non-persistent mode. Backend implementations may
 *      shrink or expand the number of persistently mapped grants without
 *      notifying the frontend depending on memory constraints (this might
 *      cause a performance degradation).
 *
 *      If a backend driver wants to limit the maximum number of persistently
 *      mapped grants to a value less than RING_SIZE *
 *      BLKIF_MAX_SEGMENTS_PER_REQUEST a LRU strategy should be used to
 *      discard the grants that are less commonly used. Using a LRU in the
 *      backend driver paired with a LIFO queue in the frontend will
 *      allow us to have better performance in this scenario.
 *
 *----------------------- Request Transport Parameters ------------------------
 *

 *
 *      The maximum supported size of the request ring buffer in units of

 *
 *      The size, in bytes, of the individually addressable discard extents
 *      of the underlying device.

 *
 *----------------------- Request Transport Parameters -----------------------
 *
 * event-channel
 *      Values:         <UINT32>
 *
 *      The identifier of the Xen event channel used to signal activity
 *      in the ring buffer.
 *
 * ring-ref
 *      Values:         <UINT32>
 *      Notes:          6
 *
 *      The Xen grant reference granting permission for the backend to map
 *      the sole page in a single page sized ring buffer.
 *
 * ring-ref%u
 *      Values:         <UINT32>
 *      Notes:          6
 *
 *      For a frontend providing a multi-page ring, a "number of ring pages"
 *      sized list of nodes, each containing a Xen grant reference granting
 *      permission for the backend to map the page of the ring located
 *      at page index "%u".  Page indexes are zero based.
 *
 * protocol
 *      Values:         string (XEN_IO_PROTO_ABI_*)
 *      Default Value:  XEN_IO_PROTO_ABI_NATIVE
 *
 *      The machine ABI rules governing the format of all ring request and
 *      response structures.
 *
 * ring-page-order
 *      Values:         <UINT32>
 *      Default Value:  0
 *      Maximum Value:  MAX(ffs(max-ring-pages) - 1, max-ring-page-order)
 *      Notes:          1, 3
 *
 *      The size of the frontend allocated request ring buffer in units
 *      of lb(machine pages). (e.g. 0 == 1 page, 1 = 2 pages, 2 == 4 pages,
 *      etc.).
 *
 * num-ring-pages
 *      Values:         <UINT32>
 *      Default Value:  1
 *      Maximum Value:  MAX(max-ring-pages,(0x1 << max-ring-page-order))
 *      Notes:          DEPRECATED, 2, 3
 *
 *      The size of the frontend allocated request ring buffer in units of
 *      machine pages.  The value must be a power of 2.
 *
 * feature-persistent
 *      Values:         0/1 (boolean)
 *      Default Value:  0
 *      Notes: 7, 8, 9
 *
 *      A value of "1" indicates that the frontend will reuse the same grants
 *      for all transactions, allowing the backend to map them with write
 *      access (even when it should be read-only). If the frontend hits the
 *      maximum number of allowed persistently mapped grants, it can fallback
 *      to non persistent mode. This will cause a performance degradation,
 *      since the backend driver will still try to map those grants
 *      persistently. Since the persistent grants protocol is compatible with
 *      the previous protocol, a frontend driver can choose to work in
 *      persistent mode even when the backend doesn't support it.
 *
 *      It is recommended that the frontend driver stores the persistently
 *      mapped grants in a LIFO queue, so a subset of all persistently mapped
 *      grants gets used commonly. This is done in case the backend driver
 *      decides to limit the maximum number of persistently mapped grants
 *      to a value less than RING_SIZE * BLKIF_MAX_SEGMENTS_PER_REQUEST.
 *
 *------------------------- Virtual Device Properties -------------------------
 *
 * device-type
 *      Values:         "disk", "cdrom", "floppy", etc.
 *
 * virtual-device
 *      Values:         <UINT32>
 *
 *      A value indicating the physical device to virtualize within the
 *      frontend's domain.  (e.g. "The first ATA disk", "The third SCSI
 *      disk", etc.)
 *
 *      See docs/misc/vbd-interface.txt for details on the format of this
 *      value.
 *
 * Notes
 * -----
 * (1) Multi-page ring buffer scheme first developed in the Citrix XenServer
 *     PV drivers.
 * (2) Multi-page ring buffer scheme first used in some RedHat distributions
 *     including a distribution deployed on certain nodes of the Amazon
 *     EC2 cluster.
 * (3) Support for multi-page ring buffers was implemented independently,
 *     in slightly different forms, by both Citrix and RedHat/Amazon.
 *     For full interoperability, block front and backends should publish
 *     identical ring parameters, adjusted for unit differences, to the
 *     XenStore nodes used in both schemes.
 * (4) Devices that support discard functionality may internally allocate space
 *     (discardable extents) in units that are larger than the exported logical
 *     block size. If the backing device has such discardable extents the
 *     backend should provide both discard-granularity and discard-alignment.
 *     Providing just one of the two may be considered an error by the frontend.
 *     Backends supporting discard should include discard-granularity and
 *     discard-alignment even if it supports discarding individual sectors.
 *     Frontends should assume discard-alignment == 0 and discard-granularity
 *     == sector size if these keys are missing.
 * (5) The discard-alignment parameter allows a physical device to be
 *     partitioned into virtual devices that do not necessarily begin or
 *     end on a discardable extent boundary.
 * (6) When there is only a single page allocated to the request ring,
 *     'ring-ref' is used to communicate the grant reference for this
 *     page to the backend.  When using a multi-page ring, the 'ring-ref'
 *     node is not created.  Instead 'ring-ref0' - 'ring-refN' are used.
 * (7) When using persistent grants data has to be copied from/to the page
 *     where the grant is currently mapped. The overhead of doing this copy
 *     however doesn't suppress the speed improvement of not having to unmap
 *     the grants.
 * (8) The frontend driver has to allow the backend driver to map all grants
 *     with write access, even when they should be mapped read-only, since
 *     further requests may reuse these grants and require write permissions.
 * (9) Linux implementation doesn't have a limit on the maximum number of
 *     grants that can be persistently mapped in the frontend driver, but
 *     due to the frontent driver implementation it should never be bigger
 *     than RING_SIZE * BLKIF_MAX_SEGMENTS_PER_REQUEST.
 *(10) The discard-secure property may be present and will be set to 1 if the
 *     backing device supports secure discard.
