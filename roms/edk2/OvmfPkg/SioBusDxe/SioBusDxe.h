/**
  Tests to see if this driver supports a given controller. If a child device is
  provided, it further tests to see if this driver supports creating a handle
  for the specified child device.

  This function checks to see if the driver specified by This supports the
  device specified by ControllerHandle. Drivers will typically use the device
  path attached to ControllerHandle and/or the services from the bus I/O
  abstraction attached to ControllerHandle to determine if the driver supports
  ControllerHandle. This function may be called many times during platform
  initialization. In order to reduce boot times, the tests performed by this
  function must be very small, and take as little time as possible to execute.
  This function must not change the state of any hardware devices, and this
  function must be aware that the device specified by ControllerHandle may
  already be managed by the same driver or a different driver. This function
  must match its calls to AllocatePages() with FreePages(), AllocatePool() with
  FreePool(), and OpenProtocol() with CloseProtocol(). Since ControllerHandle
  may have been previously started by the same driver, if a protocol is already
  in the opened state, then it must not be closed with CloseProtocol(). This is
  required to guarantee the state of ControllerHandle is not modified by this
  function.
