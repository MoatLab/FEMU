/** @file
  The EFI Legacy BIOS Protocol is used to abstract legacy Option ROM usage
  under EFI and Legacy OS boot.  This file also includes all the related
  COMPATIBILITY16 structures and definitions.

  Note: The names for EFI_IA32_REGISTER_SET elements were picked to follow
  well known naming conventions.

  Thunk is the code that switches from 32-bit protected environment into the 16-bit real-mode
  environment. Reverse thunk is the code that does the opposite.

/**
  This function attempts to traditionally boot the specified BootOption. If the EFI context has
  been compromised, this function will not return. This procedure is not used for loading an EFI-aware
  OS off a traditional device. The following actions occur:
  - Get EFI SMBIOS data structures, convert them to a traditional format, and copy to
    Compatibility16.
  - Get a pointer to ACPI data structures and copy the Compatibility16 RSD PTR to F0000 block.
  - Find the traditional SMI handler from a firmware volume and register the traditional SMI
    handler with the EFI SMI handler.
  - Build onboard IDE information and pass this information to the Compatibility16 code.
  - Make sure all PCI Interrupt Line registers are programmed to match 8259.
  - Reconfigure SIO devices from EFI mode (polled) into traditional mode (interrupt driven).
  - Shadow all PCI ROMs.
  - Set up BDA and EBDA standard areas before the legacy boot.
  - Construct the Compatibility16 boot memory map and pass it to the Compatibility16 code.
  - Invoke the Compatibility16 table function Compatibility16PrepareToBoot(). This
    invocation causes a thunk into the Compatibility16 code, which sets all appropriate internal
    data structures. The boot device list is a parameter.
  - Invoke the Compatibility16 Table function Compatibility16Boot(). This invocation
    causes a thunk into the Compatibility16 code, which does an INT19.
  - If the Compatibility16Boot() function returns, then the boot failed in a graceful
    manner--meaning that the EFI code is still valid. An ungraceful boot failure causes a reset because the state
    of EFI code is unknown.

It will either boot the                                OS or reset the system if memory has been "corrupted" by loading                                a boot sector and passing control to it.
