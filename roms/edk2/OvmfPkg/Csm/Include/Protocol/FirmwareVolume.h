  This file declares the Firmware Volume Protocol.

  The Firmware Volume Protocol provides file-level access to the firmware volume.
  Each firmware volume driver must produce an instance of the Firmware Volume
  Protocol if the firmware volume is to be visible to the system. The Firmware
  Volume Protocol also provides mechanisms for determining and modifying some
  attributes of the firmware volume.
