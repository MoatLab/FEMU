  This function adjusts the period of timer interrupts to the value specified
  by TimerPeriod.  If the timer period is updated, then the selected timer
  period is stored in EFI_TIMER.TimerPeriod, and EFI_SUCCESS is returned.  If
  the timer hardware is not programmable, then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is returned.
  If an error occurs while attempting to update the timer period, then the
  timer hardware will be put back in its state prior to this call, and
  EFI_DEVICE_ERROR is returned.  If TimerPeriod is 0, then the timer interrupt
  is disabled.  This is not the same as disabling the CPU's interrupts.
  Instead, it must either turn off the timer hardware, or it must adjust the
  interrupt controller so that a CPU interrupt is not generated when the timer
  interrupt fires.

                         will be rounded up to the nearest timer period that is supported
                         by the timer hardware.  If TimerPeriod is set to 0, then the
