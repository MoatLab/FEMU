/**
  Retrieves a Unicode string that is the user readable name of the controller
  that is being managed by an EFI Driver.

  @param  This             A pointer to the EFI_COMPONENT_NAME_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param  ControllerHandle The handle of a controller that the driver specified by
                           This is managing.  This handle specifies the controller
                           whose name is to be returned.
  @param  ChildHandle      The handle of the child controller to retrieve the name
                           of.  This is an optional parameter that may be NULL.  It
                           will be NULL for device drivers.  It will also be NULL
                           for a bus drivers that wish to retrieve the name of the
                           bus controller.  It will not be NULL for a bus driver
                           that wishes to retrieve the name of a child controller.
  @param  Language         A pointer to a three character ISO 639-2 language
                           identifier.  This is the language of the controller name
                           that the caller is requesting, and it must match one
                           of the languages specified in SupportedLanguages.  The
                           number of languages supported by a driver is up to the
                           driver writer.
  @param  ControllerName   A pointer to the Unicode string to return.  This Unicode
                           string is the name of the controller specified by
                           ControllerHandle and ChildHandle in the language specified
                           by Language, from the point of view of the driver specified
                           by This.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The Unicode string for the user-readable name in the
                                language specified by Language for the driver
                                specified by This was returned in DriverName.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER ControllerHandle is NULL.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER ChildHandle is not NULL and it is not a valid EFI_HANDLE.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER Language is NULL.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER ControllerName is NULL.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The driver specified by This is not currently managing
                                the controller specified by ControllerHandle and
                                ChildHandle.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The driver specified by This does not support the
                                language specified by Language.
