# This is a sample to demonstrates the use of GoogleTest that supports host
# execution environments for test case that generates an exception. For some
# host-based environments, this is a fatal condition that terminates the unit
# tests and no additional test cases are executed. On other environments, this
# condition may be report a unit test failure and continue with additional unit
# tests.
