  RNG Driver to produce the UEFI Random Number Generator protocol.

  The driver will use the new RDRAND instruction to produce high-quality, high-performance
  entropy and random number.

  RNG Algorithms defined in UEFI 2.4:
   - EFI_RNG_ALGORITHM_SP800_90_CTR_256_GUID  - Supported
     (RDRAND implements a hardware NIST SP800-90 AES-CTR-256 based DRBG)
   - EFI_RNG_ALGORITHM_RAW                    - Supported
     (Structuring RDRAND invocation can be guaranteed as high-quality entropy source)
   - EFI_RNG_ALGORITHM_SP800_90_HMAC_256_GUID - Unsupported
   - EFI_RNG_ALGORITHM_SP800_90_HASH_256_GUID - Unsupported
   - EFI_RNG_ALGORITHM_X9_31_3DES_GUID        - Unsupported
   - EFI_RNG_ALGORITHM_X9_31_AES_GUID         - Unsupported

  @param[in]  This                    A pointer to the EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in]  RNGAlgorithm            A pointer to the EFI_RNG_ALGORITHM that identifies the RNG

  @param[in]  RNGValueLength          The length in bytes of the memory buffer pointed to by
                                      RNGValue. The driver shall return exactly this numbers of bytes.
  @param[out] RNGValue                A caller-allocated memory buffer filled by the driver with the
                                      resulting RNG value.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS                 The RNG value was returned successfully.

                                      this driver.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR            An RNG value could not be retrieved due to a hardware or
                                      firmware error.
  @retval EFI_NOT_READY               There is not enough random data available to satisfy the length
                                      requested by RNGValueLength.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER       RNGValue is NULL or RNGValueLength is zero.
