/** @file
  This library provides a set of utility APIs that allow to create/read/update/delete
  (CRUD) Redfish resources and provide basic query abilities by using [URI/RedPath]
  (https://github.com/DMTF/libredfish).

  The query language is based on XPath (https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116/).
  This library and query language essentially treat the entire Redfish Service like it
  was a single JSON document. In other words whenever it encounters an odata.id in JSON
  document, it will retrieve the new JSON document (if needed). We name the path as
  RedPath:

  Expression       Description

  nodename         Selects the JSON entity with the name "nodename".
                   If the value of nodename is an object with "@odata.id",
                   it will continue get the value from "@odata.id".

  /                Selects from the root node

  [index]           Selects the index number JSON entity from an array or
                   object. If the JSON entity is one collection (has
                   Members & Members@odata.count), means to get the index
                   member in "Members". Index number >=1, 1 means to return
                   the first instance.

  [XXX]            Operation on JSON entity.
                   If the JSON entity is one collection (has Members &
                   Members@odata.count), means to get all elements in
                   "Members". If the JSON entity is one array, means to
                   get all elements in array. Others will match the nodename
                   directly (e.g. JSON_OBJECT, JSON_STRING, JSON_TRUE,
                   JSON_FALSE, JSON_INTEGER).

  [nodename]       Selects all the elements from an JSON entity that
                   contain a property named "nodename"

  [name=value]     Selects all the elements from an JSON entity where
                   the property "name" is equal to "value"

  [name~value]     Selects all the elements from an JSON entity where
                   the string property "name" is equal to "value" using
                   case insensitive comparison.

  [name<value]     Selects all the elements from an JSON entity where
                   the property "name" is less than "value"

  [name<=value]    Selects all the elements from an JSON entity where
                   the property "name" is less than or equal to "value"

  [name>value]     Selects all the elements from an JSON entity where
                   the property "name" is greater than "value"

  [name>=value]    Selects all the elements from an JSON entity where
                   the property "name" is greater than or equal to "value"

  Some examples:

    /v1/Chassis[1]        - Will return the first Chassis instance.
    /v1/Chassis[SKU=1234] - Will return all Chassis instances with a SKU field equal to 1234.
    /v1/Systems[Storage]  - Will return all the System instances that have Storage field populated.
