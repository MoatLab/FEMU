A. INTRODUCTION
================================================================================
This document provides instructions on how to build UEFI Payload and how to
integrate it into coreboot or Slim Bootloader firmware.

================================================================================
B. HOW TO BUILD
================================================================================
1. Run the below two commands in windows command prompt window:
   > edksetup.bat

   For pure X64 build:
   > build -a x64 -p UefiPayloadPkg\UefiPayloadPkg.dsc -b <BuildType> -t <ToolChain>
     -D BOOTLOADER=<Bootloader>

   For X64 build with IA32 entry point:
   > build -a IA32 -a X64 -p UefiPayloadPkg\UefiPayloadPkg.dsc -b <BuildType> -t <ToolChain>
     -D BOOTLOADER=<Bootloader>

   <BuildType> support 'DEBUG', 'RELEASE' and 'NOOPT'.
   <ToolChain> is the EDK II build environment on your host. Tested with VS2015x86 toolchain.
   <Bootloader> could be "SBL" for Slim Bootloader and "COREBOOT" for coreboot.

   Refer to https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/UDK2018-How-to-Build for
   details about EDK II build steps.

   NOTE: Pure 32bit UEFI payload support could be added if required later.

2. If build is successfully, the payload image (UEFIPAYLOAD.fd) will be generated inside the
   folder of Build\UefiPayloadPkg.

================================================================================
C. HOW TO INTEGRATE INTO COREBOOT
================================================================================
1. Copy the payload image (UEFIPAYLOAD.fd) into the top-level directory of Coreboot source tree.
2. Run "make menuconfig" in linux console to start Coreboot configuration surface.
3. In the Payload section,
   1) Choose "Tianocore Payload" for the option of "Add a payload".
   2) Update the path of payload image for the option of "Tianocore binary".
   3) Choose "UEFIPayload" for the option of "Tianocore Payload".
4. If the graphics console is required in UEFI payload, enable framebuffer initialization in coreboot.
   This could be done by enabling native graphics or using VGA BIOS option rom.
5. Build the coreboot firmware image.
6. If meet build error "E: Not a usable UEFI firmware volume.", please update Coreboot source tree
   to the latest, or refer https://review.coreboot.org/c/coreboot/+/57296

================================================================================
D. HOW TO INTEGRATE INTO SLIM BOOTLOADER
================================================================================
Please refer https://slimbootloader.github.io/how-tos/integrate-multiple-payloads.html for below steps.
1. Copy the payload image (UEFIPAYLOAD.fd) into Slim Bootloader source at PayloadPkg\PayloadBins\UefiPld.fd
2. Update config data to make UEFI payload as default payload if required.
3. Build Slim Bootloader with UEFI payload:
   BuildLoader.py build <Platform> -p "OsLoader.efi:LLDR:Lz4;UefiPld.fd:UEFI:Lzma"
