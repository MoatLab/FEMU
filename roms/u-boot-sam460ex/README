This is U-Boot for sam460ex emulation in QEMU.
See README.u-boot for original U-Boot README.

This is based on ACube's u-boot-2010.06.05_20110414_prod version which 
itself has board specific changes compared to upstream U-Boot but this
version has additional fixes and changes that were only tested on QEMU
not on real hardware. Therefore you should not try to use it on real
hardware as it may not work or may cause problems.

THIS IS ONLY FOR THE EMULATED SAM460EX IN QEMU, NOT FOR USE ON REAL BOARD.
