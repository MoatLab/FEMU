SeaBIOS is an open source implementation of a 16bit X86 BIOS. SeaBIOS
can run in an emulator or it can run natively on X86 hardware with the

SeaBIOS is the default BIOS for [qemu](http://www.qemu.org/) and
[kvm](http://www.linux-kvm.org/).

The [coreboot SeaBIOS](http://www.coreboot.org/SeaBIOS) page has
information on using SeaBIOS in coreboot. Please see the
[releases](Releases) page for information on recent releases. See the
[download](Download) page to obtain SeaBIOS.

[SeaVGABIOS](SeaVGABIOS) is a sub-project of SeaBIOS.
