# This file contains help messages for missing external blobs. Each message has
# a tag (MUST be just lower-case text, digits and hyphens) starting in column 1,
# followed by a colon (:) to indicate its start. The message can include any
# number of lines, including blank lines.
#
# When looking for a tag, Binman uses the value of 'missing-msg' for the entry,
# the entry name or the entry type, in that order
