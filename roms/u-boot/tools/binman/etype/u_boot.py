    This is the U-Boot binary, containing relocation information to allow it
    to relocate itself at runtime. The binary typically includes a device tree
    blob at the end of it.

    U-Boot can access binman symbols at runtime. See:

        'Access to binman entry offsets at run time (fdt)'

    in the binman README for more information.

    Note that this entry is automatically replaced with u-boot-expanded unless
    --no-expanded is used or the node has a 'no-expanded' property.
