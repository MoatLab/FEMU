	help
	  Select this option to enable the STM32 FMC2 External Bus Interface
	  controller. This driver configures the transactions with external
	  devices (like SRAM, ethernet adapters, FPGAs, LCD displays, ...) on
	  SOCs containing the FMC2 External Bus Interface.

	depends on ARCH_KEYSTONE
	help
	  This driver is for the AEMIF module available in Texas Instruments
	  SoCs. AEMIF stands for Asynchronous External Memory Interface and
	  is intended to provide a glue-less interface to a variety of
	  asynchronuous memory devices like ASRAM, NOR and NAND memory. A total
	  of 256M bytes of any of these memories can be accessed at a given
	  time via four chip selects with 64M byte access per chip select.
