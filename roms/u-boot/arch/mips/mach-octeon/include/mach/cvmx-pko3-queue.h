 * @param child_count is the number of consecutive children to assign
 * @param stat_prio_count is the priority setting for the children L2 SQs
 *
 * If <stat_prio_count> is -1, the Ln children will have equal Round-Robin
 * relationship with eachother. If <stat_prio_count> is 0, all Ln children
 * will be arranged in Weighted-Round-Robin, with the first having the most
