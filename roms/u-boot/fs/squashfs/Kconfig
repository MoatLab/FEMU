	  This provides support for reading images from SquashFS filesystem.
	  Squashfs is a compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.
	  It uses zlib, lz4, lzo, or xz compression to compress files, inodes
	  and directories. Squashfs is intended for general read-only
	  filesystem use, for archival use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file
	  may be used), and in constrained block device/memory systems (e.g.
	  embedded systems) where low overhead is needed.
