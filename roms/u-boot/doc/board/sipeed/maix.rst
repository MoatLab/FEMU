MAIX
====

Several of the Sipeed Maix series of boards cotain the Kendryte K210 processor,
a 64-bit RISC-V CPU. This processor contains several peripherals to accelerate
neural network processing and other "ai" tasks. This includes a "KPU" neural
network processor, an audio processor supporting beamforming reception, and a
digital video port supporting capture and output at VGA resolution. Other
peripherals include 8M of SRAM (accessible with and without caching); remappable
pins, including 40 GPIOs; AES, FFT, and SHA256 accelerators; a DMA controller;
and I2C, I2S, and SPI controllers. Maix peripherals vary, but include spi flash;
on-board usb-serial bridges; ports for cameras, displays, and sd cards; and
ESP32 chips.

Currently, only the Sipeed MAIX BiT V2.0 (bitm) and Sipeed MAIXDUINO are
supported, but the boards are fairly similar.

Documentation for Maix boards is available from
`Sipeed's website <http://dl.sipeed.com/MAIX/HDK/>`_.
Documentation for the Kendryte K210 is available from
`Kendryte's website <https://kendryte.com/downloads/>`_. However, hardware
details are rather lacking, so most technical reference has been taken from the
`standalone sdk <https://github.com/kendryte/kendryte-standalone-sdk>`_.

Build and boot steps
--------------------

To build U-Boot, run

.. code-block:: none

    make <defconfig>
    make CROSS_COMPILE=<your cross compile prefix>

To flash U-Boot, run

.. code-block:: none

    kflash -tp /dev/<your tty here> -B <board_id> u-boot-dtb.bin

The board provides two serial devices, e.g.

* /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Kongou_Hikari_Sipeed-Debug_12345678AB-if00-port0
* /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Kongou_Hikari_Sipeed-Debug_12345678AB-if01-port0

Which one is used for flashing depends on the board.

Currently only a small subset of the board features are supported. So we can
use the same default configuration and device tree. In the long run we may need
separate settings.

======================== ========================== ========== ==========

Sipeed MAIX ONE DOCK                                dan        first
======================== ========================== ========== ==========

Flashing causes a reboot of the device. Parameter -t specifies that the serial
console shall be opened immediately. Boot output should look like the following:

.. code-block:: none

    U-Boot 2020.04-rc2-00087-g2221cc09c1-dirty (Feb 28 2020 - 13:53:09 -0500)

    Err:   serial@38000000
    =>

OpenSBI
^^^^^^^

OpenSBI is an open source supervisor execution environment implementing the
RISC-V Supervisor Binary Interface Specification [1]. One of its features is
to intercept run-time exceptions, e.g. for unaligned access or illegal
instructions, and to emulate the failing instructions.

The OpenSBI source can be downloaded via:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/riscv/opensbi

As OpenSBI will be loaded at 0x80000000 we have to adjust the U-Boot text base.
Furthermore we have to enable building U-Boot for S-mode::

    CONFIG_SYS_TEXT_BASE=0x80020000
    CONFIG_RISCV_SMODE=y

Both settings are contained in sipeed_maix_smode_defconfig so we can build
U-Boot with:

.. code-block:: bash

    make sipeed_maix_smode_defconfig
    make

To build OpenSBI with U-Boot as a payload:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd opensbi
    make \
    PLATFORM=kendryte/k210 \
    FW_PAYLOAD=y \
    FW_PAYLOAD_OFFSET=0x20000 \
    FW_PAYLOAD_PATH=<path to U-Boot>/u-boot-dtb.bin

The value of FW_PAYLOAD_OFFSET must match CONFIG_SYS_TEXT_BASE - 0x80000000.

The file to flash is build/platform/kendryte/k210/firmware/fw_payload.bin.

Booting
^^^^^^^

The default boot process is to load and boot the files ``/uImage`` and
``/k210.dtb`` off of the first partition of the MMC. For Linux, this will result
in an output like

.. code-block:: none

    U-Boot 2020.10-00691-gd1d651d988-dirty (Oct 16 2020 - 17:05:24 -0400)

Loading, Booting, and Storing Images
------------------------------------

.. _loading:

Loading Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Serial
""""""

Use the ``loady`` command to load images over serial.

.. code-block:: none

    => loady $loadaddr 1500000
    ## Switch baudrate to 1500000 bps and press ENTER ...

    *** baud: 1500000

    *** baud: 115200

    *** baud: 115200 ***
    =>

This command does not set ``$filesize``, so it may need to be set manually.

SPI Flash
"""""""""

To load an image off of SPI flash, first set up a partition as described in
:ref:`k210_partitions`. Then, use ``mtd`` to load that partition

.. code-block:: none

    => sf probe
    SF: Detected w25q128fw with page size 256 Bytes, erase size 4 KiB, total 16 MiB
    => mtd read linux $loadaddr
    Reading 2097152 byte(s) at offset 0x00000000

This command does not set ``$filesize``, so it may need to be set manually.

MMC
"""

The MMC device number is 0. To list partitions on the device, use ``part``:

.. code-block:: none

    => part list mmc 0

    Partition Map for MMC device 0  --   Partition Type: EFI

    Part    Start LBA       End LBA          Name
            Attributes
            Type GUID
            Partition GUID
      1     0x00000800      0x039effde      "boot"

            guid:   96161f7d-7113-4cc7-9a24-08ab7fc5cb72

To list files, use ``ls``:

.. code-block:: none

    => ls mmc 0:1
    <DIR>       4096 .
    <DIR>       4096 ..
    <DIR>      16384 lost+found
               13428 k210.dtb
             1827380 uImage

To load a file, use ``load``:

.. code-block:: none

    => load mmc 0:1 $loadaddr uImage
    1827380 bytes read in 1049 ms (1.7 MiB/s)

Running Programs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Binaries
""""""""

To run a bare binary, use the ``go`` command:

.. code-block:: none

    => go 80000000
    ## Starting application at 0x80000000 ...
    Example expects ABI version 9
    Actual U-Boot ABI version 9
    Hello World
    argc = 1
    argv[0] = "80000000"
    argv[1] = "<NULL>"
    Hit any key to exit ...

Note that this will only start a program on one hart. As-of this writing it is
only possible to start a program on multiple harts using the ``bootm`` command.

Legacy Images
"""""""""""""

To create a legacy image, use ``tools/mkimage``:

.. code-block:: none

    $ tools/mkimage -A riscv -O linux -T kernel -C none -a 0x80000000 -e 0x80000000 -n linux -d ../linux-git/arch/riscv/boot/Image uImage
    Image Name:   linux
    Created:      Fri Oct 16 17:36:32 2020
    Image Type:   RISC-V Linux Kernel Image (uncompressed)
    Data Size:    1827316 Bytes = 1784.49 KiB = 1.74 MiB
    Load Address: 80000000
    Entry Point:  80000000

The ``bootm`` command also requires an FDT, even if the image doesn't require
one. After loading the image to ``$loadaddr`` and the FDT to ``$fdt_addr_r``,
boot with:

.. code-block:: none

    => bootm $loadaddr - $fdt_addr_r
    ## Booting kernel from Legacy Image at 80060000 ...
       Image Name:   linux
       Image Type:   RISC-V Linux Kernel Image (uncompressed)
       Data Size:    1827316 Bytes = 1.7 MiB
       Load Address: 80000000
       Entry Point:  80000000
       Verifying Checksum ... OK
    ## Flattened Device Tree blob at 80400000
       Booting using the fdt blob at 0x80400000
       Loading Kernel Image
       Loading Device Tree to 00000000803f9000, end 00000000803ff473 ... OK

    Starting kernel ...

The FDT is verified after the kernel is relocated, so it must be loaded high
enough so that it won't be overwritten. The default values for ``$loadaddr``
and ``$fdt_addr_r`` should provide ample headroom for most use-cases.

Flashing Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SPI Flash
"""""""""

To flash data to SPI flash, first load it using one of the methods in
:ref:`loading`. Addiotionally, create some partitions as described in
:ref:`partitions`. Then use the ``mtd`` command:

.. code-block:: none

    => sf probe
    SF: Detected w25q128fw with page size 256 Bytes, erase size 4 KiB, total 16 MiB
    => mtd write linux $loadaddr 0 $filesize
    Writing 2478162 byte(s) at offset 0x00000000

Note that in order to write a bootable image, a header and tailer must be added.

MMC
"""

MMC writes are unsupported for now.

SPI Flash
^^^^^^^^^

Sipeed MAIX boards typically provide around 16 MiB of SPI NOR flash. U-Boot is
stored in the first 1 MiB or so of this flash. U-Boot's environment is stored at
the end of flash.

.. _k210_partitions:

Partitions
""""""""""

There is no set data layout. The default partition layout only allocates
partitions for U-Boot and its default environment

.. code-block:: none

    => mtd list
    List of MTD devices:
    * nor0
      - type: NOR flash
      - block size: 0x1000 bytes
      - min I/O: 0x1 bytes
      - 0x000000000000-0x000001000000 : "nor0"
          - 0x000000000000-0x000000100000 : "u-boot"
          - 0x000000fff000-0x000001000000 : "env"

As an example, to allocate 2MiB for Linux and (almost) 13 MiB for other data,
set the ``mtdparts`` like:

.. code-block:: none

    => env set mtdparts nor0:1M(u-boot),2M(linux),0xcff000(data),0x1000@0xfff000(env)
    => mtd list
    List of MTD devices:
    * nor0
      - type: NOR flash
      - block size: 0x1000 bytes
      - min I/O: 0x1 bytes
      - 0x000000000000-0x000001000000 : "nor0"
          - 0x000000000000-0x000000100000 : "u-boot"
          - 0x000000100000-0x000000300000 : "linux"
          - 0x000000300000-0x000000fff000 : "data"
          - 0x000000fff000-0x000001000000 : "env"

To make these changes permanent, save the environment:

.. code-block:: none

    => env save
    Saving Environment to SPIFlash... Erasing SPI flash...Writing to SPI flash...done
    OK

U-Boot will always load the environment from the last 4 KiB of flash.

Over- and Under-clocking
------------------------

To change the clock speed of the K210, you will need to enable
``CONFIG_CLK_K210_SET_RATE`` and edit the board's device tree. To do this, add a
section to ``arch/riscv/arch/riscv/dts/k210-maix-bit.dts`` like the following:

.. code-block:: none

    &sysclk {
	assigned-clocks = <&sysclk K210_CLK_PLL0>;
	assigned-clock-rates = <800000000>;
    };

There are three PLLs on the K210: PLL0 is the parent of most of the components,
including the CPU and RAM. PLL1 is the parent of the neural network coprocessor.
PLL2 is the parent of the sound processing devices. Note that child clocks of
PLL0 and PLL2 run at *half* the speed of the PLLs. For example, if PLL0 is
running at 800 MHz, then the CPU will run at 400 MHz. This is the example given
above. The CPU can be overclocked to around 600 MHz, and underclocked to 26 MHz.

It is possible to set PLL2's parent to PLL0. The plls are more accurate when
converting between similar frequencies. This makes it easier to get an accurate
frequency for I2S. As an example, consider sampling an I2S device at 44.1 kHz.
On this device, the I2S serial clock runs at 64 times the sample rate.
Therefore, we would like to run PLL2 at an even multiple of 2.8224 MHz. If
PLL2's parent is IN0, we could use a frequency of 390 MHz (the same as the CPU's
default speed).  Dividing by 138 yields a serial clock of about 2.8261 MHz. This
results in a sample rate of 44.158 kHz---around 50 Hz or .1% too fast. If,
instead, we set PLL2's parent to PLL1 running at 390 MHz, and request a rate of
2.8224 * 136 = 383.8464 MHz, the achieved rate is 383.90625 MHz. Dividing by 136
yields a serial clock of about 2.8228 MHz. This results in a sample rate of
44.107 kHz---just 7 Hz or .02% too fast. This configuration is shown in the
following example:

.. code-block:: none

    &sysclk {
	assigned-clocks = <&sysclk K210_CLK_PLL1>, <&sysclk K210_CLK_PLL2>;
	assigned-clock-parents = <0>, <&sysclk K210_CLK_PLL1>;
	assigned-clock-rates = <390000000>, <383846400>;
    };

There are a couple of quirks to the PLLs. First, there are more frequency ratios
just above and below 1.0, but there is a small gap around 1.0. To be explicit,
if the input frequency is 100 MHz, it would be impossible to have an output of
99 or 101 MHz. In addition, there is a maximum frequency for the internal VCO,
so higher input/output frequencies will be less accurate than lower ones.

Technical Details
-----------------

Boot Sequence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. ``RESET`` pin is deasserted. The pin is connected to the ``RESET`` button. It
   can also be set to low via either the ``DTR`` or the ``RTS`` line of the
   serial interface (depending on the board).
2. Both harts begin executing at ``0x00001000``.
3. Both harts jump to firmware at ``0x88000000``.
4. One hart is chosen as a boot hart.
5. Firmware reads the value of pin ``IO_16`` (ISP). This pin is connected to the
   ``BOOT`` button. The pin can equally be set to low via either the ``DTR`` or
   ``RTS`` line of the serial interface (depending on the board).

   * If the pin is low, enter ISP mode. This mode allows loading data to ram,
     writing it to flash, and booting from specific addresses.
   * If the pin is high, continue boot.
6. Firmware reads the next stage from flash (SPI3) to address ``0x80000000``.

   * If byte 0 is 1, the next stage is decrypted using the built-in AES
     accelerator and the one-time programmable, 128-bit AES key.
   * Bytes 1 to 4 hold the length of the next stage.
   * The SHA-256 sum of the next stage is automatically calculated, and verified
     against the 32 bytes following the next stage.
7. The boot hart sends an IPI to the other hart telling it to jump to the next
   stage.
8. The boot hart jumps to ``0x80000000``.

Debug UART
^^^^^^^^^^

The Debug UART is provided with the following settings::

    CONFIG_DEBUG_UART=y
    CONFIG_DEBUG_UART_SIFIVE=y
    CONFIG_DEBUG_UART_BASE=0x38000000
    CONFIG_DEBUG_UART_CLOCK=390000000

Resetting the board
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MAIX boards can be reset using the DTR and RTS lines of the serial console.
How the lines are used depends on the specific board. See the code of kflash.py
for details.

This is the reset sequence for the MAXDUINO and MAIX BiT with Mic:

.. code-block:: python

   def reset(self):
        self.device.setDTR(False)
        self.device.setRTS(False)
        time.sleep(0.1)
        self.device.setDTR(True)
        time.sleep(0.1)
        self.device.setDTR(False)
        time.sleep(0.1)

and this for the MAIX Bit:

.. code-block:: python

   def reset(self):
        self.device.setDTR(False)
        self.device.setRTS(False)
        time.sleep(0.1)
        self.device.setRTS(True)
        time.sleep(0.1)
        self.device.setRTS(False)
        time.sleep(0.1)
