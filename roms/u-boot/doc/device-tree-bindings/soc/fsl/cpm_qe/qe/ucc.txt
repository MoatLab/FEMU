* UCC (Unified Communications Controllers)

Required properties:
- compatible : ucc_geth
- cell-index : the ucc number(1-8), corresponding to UCCx in UM.
- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
- rx-clock-name: the UCC receive clock source
  "none": clock source is disabled
  "brg1" through "brg16": clock source is BRG1-BRG16, respectively
  "clk1" through "clk24": clock source is CLK1-CLK24, respectively
- tx-clock-name: the UCC transmit clock source
  "none": clock source is disabled
  "brg1" through "brg16": clock source is BRG1-BRG16, respectively
  "clk1" through "clk24": clock source is CLK1-CLK24, respectively
The following two properties are deprecated.  rx-clock has been replaced
with rx-clock-name, and tx-clock has been replaced with tx-clock-name.
Drivers that currently use the deprecated properties should continue to
do so, in order to support older device trees, but they should be updated
to check for the new properties first.
- rx-clock : represents the UCC receive clock source.
  0x00 : clock source is disabled;
  0x1~0x10 : clock source is BRG1~BRG16 respectively;
  0x11~0x28: clock source is QE_CLK1~QE_CLK24 respectively.
- tx-clock: represents the UCC transmit clock source;
  0x00 : clock source is disabled;
  0x1~0x10 : clock source is BRG1~BRG16 respectively;
  0x11~0x28: clock source is QE_CLK1~QE_CLK24 respectively.
- phy-handle : The phandle for the PHY connected to this controller.
- phy-connection-type : a string naming the controller/PHY interface type,
  i.e., "mii" (default), "rmii", "gmii", "rgmii", "rgmii-id" (Internal
  Delay), "rgmii-txid" (delay on TX only), "rgmii-rxid" (delay on RX only),
  "tbi", or "rtbi".
- pio-handle : The phandle for the Parallel I/O port configuration.

Deprecated properties:
- device-id : the ucc number(1-8), corresponding to UCCx in UM.
    you should use cell-index

Example:
        ucc@2000 {
                device_type = "network";
                compatible = "ucc_geth";
                cell-index = <1>;
                reg = <2000 200>;
                interrupts = <a0 0>;
                interrupt-parent = <700>;
                mac-address = [ 00 04 9f 00 23 23 ];
                rx-clock = "none";
                tx-clock = "clk9";
                phy-handle = <212000>;
                phy-connection-type = "gmii";
                pio-handle = <140001>;
        };
