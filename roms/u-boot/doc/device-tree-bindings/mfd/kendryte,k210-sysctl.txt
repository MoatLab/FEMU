Kendryte K210 Sysctl

This binding describes the K210 sysctl device, which contains many miscellaneous
registers controlling system functionality. This node is a register map and can
be reference by other bindings which need a phandle to the K210 sysctl regmap.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be
	"kendryte,k210-sysctl", "syscon", "simple-mfd"
- reg: address and length of the sysctl registers
- reg-io-width: must be <4>

Clock sub-node

This node is a binding for the clock tree driver

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "kendryte,k210-clk"
- clocks: phandle to the "in0" external oscillator
- #clock-cells: must be <1>

Example:
sysctl: syscon@50440000 {
	compatible = "kendryte,k210-sysctl", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
	reg = <0x50440000 0x100>;
	reg-io-width = <4>;

	sysclk: clock-controller {
		compatible = "kendryte,k210-clk";
		clocks = <&in0>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};
};
