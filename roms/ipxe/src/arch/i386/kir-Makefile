# Makefile to build a KEEP_IT_REAL flavour
# 
# KEEP_IT_REAL, by its nature, requires a different build of every
# single object file, since the inclusion of ".code16gcc" will
# generate different machine code from the assembly.  Unlike the other
# config options, there is no way that this global dependency can ever
# be reduced, so it makes sense to be able to build both the normal
# and the KIR versions without having to force a full rebuild each
# time.

# Add this Makefile to MAKEDEPS
#
MAKEDEPS	+= arch/i386/kir-Makefile

# Place binaries in bin-kir
#
BIN		= bin-kir

# Compile with -DKEEP_IT_REAL, forcibly include kir.h at the start of
# each file to drag in ".code16gcc"
#
CFLAGS		+= -DKEEP_IT_REAL -include kir.h
