This folder contains fio tests to measure the FEMU NVMe Performance.

There are two modes that FEMU runs in -
a) Blackbox mode - which does not model the SSDs internal mechanisms and uses a RAW RAM.
b) Whitebox mode - which models flash internals according to OCSSD 1.2 specifications.

The two modes can be configured using the scripts in iscos_scripts/ directory

Blackbox mode is run using run-blackbox.sh
Whitebox mode is run using run-whitebox.sh

The experiments are run using 100GB and 10GB NVMe disk sizes, which can be tuned using
the parameter `devsz_mb` in the run-*box.sh scripts.

All measurements are in MBps
